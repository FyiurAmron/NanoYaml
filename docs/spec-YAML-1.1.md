## Chapter 1. Introduction

“YAML Ain’t Markup Language” (abbreviated YAML) is a data
serialization language designed to be human-friendly and work well with
modern programming languages for common everyday tasks. This
specification is both an introduction to the YAML language and the
concepts supporting it; it is also a complete reference of the
information needed to develop applications for processing YAML.

Open, interoperable and readily understandable tools have advanced
computing immensely. YAML was designed from the start to be useful and
friendly to people working with data. It uses Unicode printable characters, some of
which provide structural information and the rest containing the data
itself. YAML achieves a unique cleanness by minimizing the amount of
structural characters and allowing the data to show itself in a natural
and meaningful way. For example, indentation may be used for structure, colons separate
“mapping
key: value” pairs, and dashes are used to create
“bullet” lists.

There are myriad flavors of data structures, but they can all be
adequately represented with three
basic primitives: mappings (hashes/dictionaries), sequences
(arrays/lists) and scalars (strings/numbers). YAML leverages these
primitives and adds a simple typing system and aliasing mechanism to form a
complete language for serializing any data structure. While most
programming languages can use YAML for data serialization, YAML excels in
working with those languages that are fundamentally built around the
three basic primitives. These include the new wave of agile languages
such as Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby, and Javascript.

There are hundreds of different languages for programming, but only a
handful of languages for storing and transferring data. Even though its
potential is virtually boundless, YAML was specifically created to work
well for common use cases such as: configuration files, log files,
interprocess messaging, cross-language data sharing, object persistence,
and debugging of complex data structures. When data is easy to view and
understand, programming becomes a simpler task.

## 1.1. Goals

The design goals for YAML are:

1.  YAML is easily readable by humans.
2.  YAML matches the native data structures of agile languages.
3.  YAML data is portable between programming languages.
4.  YAML has a consistent model to support generic tools.
5.  YAML supports one-pass processing.
6.  YAML is expressive and extensible.
7.  YAML is easy to implement and use.

## 1.2. Prior Art

YAML’s initial direction was set by the data serialization and
markup language discussions among http://www.docuverse.com/smldev/. Later
on, it directly incorporated experience from Brian Ingerson’s Perl
module http://search.cpan.org/doc/INGY/Data-Denter-0.13/Denter.pod. Since then, YAML has matured through ideas and
support from its user community.

YAML integrates and builds upon concepts described by http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/cbook/index.html,
http://java.sun.com/, http://www.perl.org/, http://www.python.org/, http://www.ruby-lang.org/,
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc0822.txt (MAIL),
http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/rfc1866.txt
(HTML), http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt (MIME),
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt (URI),
http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml.html, http://www.saxproject.org/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/SOAP.

The syntax of YAML was motivated by Internet Mail (RFC0822) and remains
partially compatible with that standard. Further, borrowing from MIME
(RFC2045), YAML’s top-level production is a stream of
independent documents; ideal for message-based distributed
processing systems.

YAML’s indentation-based scoping is similar to Python’s
(without the ambiguities caused by tabs). Indented blocks facilitate easy
inspection of the data’s structure. YAML’s literal
style leverages this by enabling formatted text to be cleanly
mixed within an indented
structure without troublesome escaping. YAML also allows the use of
traditional indicator-based
scoping similar to Perl’s. Such flow content can be freely
nested inside indented blocks.

YAML’s double-quoted style uses familiar C-style escape sequences.
This enables ASCII encoding of non-printable or 8-bit (ISO 8859-1) characters such as
“**`\x3B`**”. Non-printable 16-bit Unicode and
32-bit (ISO/IEC 10646) characters are supported with escape sequences
such as “**`\u003B`**”
and “**`\U0000003B`**”.

Motivated by HTML’s end-of-line normalization, YAML’s line folding employs an intuitive
method of handling line
breaks. A single line
break is folded
into a single space, while empty
lines are interpreted as line break characters. This technique allows for
paragraphs to be word-wrapped without affecting the canonical form of the content.

YAML’s core type system is based on the requirements of agile
languages such as Perl, Python, and Ruby. YAML directly supports both
collection (mapping, sequence)
and scalar
content. Support for common types enables programmers to use
their language’s native data structures for YAML manipulation,
instead of requiring a special document object model (DOM).

Like XML’s SOAP, YAML supports serializing native graph data structures
through an aliasing mechanism. Also like SOAP, YAML provides for
application-defined types. This
allows YAML to represent rich
data structures required for modern distributed computing. YAML
provides globally unique type
names using a namespace mechanism inspired by Java’s
DNS-based package naming convention and XML’s URI-based namespaces.

YAML was designed to support incremental interfaces that include both
input (“**`getNextEvent()`**”) and output
“**`sendNextEvent()`**”) one-pass interfaces. Together, these
enable YAML to support the processing of large documents
(e.g. transaction logs) or continuous streams (e.g. feeds from a
production machine).

## 1.3. Relation to XML

Newcomers to YAML often search for its correlation to the eXtensible
Markup Language (XML). Although the two languages may actually compete
in several application domains, there is no direct correlation between
them.

YAML is primarily a data serialization language. XML was designed to be
backwards compatible with the Standard Generalized Markup Language
(SGML) and thus had many design constraints placed on it that YAML does
not share. Inheriting SGML’s legacy, XML is designed to support
structured documentation, where YAML is more closely targeted at data
structures and messaging. Where XML is a pioneer in many domains, YAML
is the result of lessons learned from XML and other technologies.

It should be mentioned that there are ongoing efforts to define
standard XML/YAML mappings. This generally requires that a subset of
each language be used. For more information on using both XML and YAML,
please visit [/xml/index.html](https://yaml.org/xml/index.html).

## 1.4. Terminology

This specification uses key words based on http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt to indicate
requirement level. In particular, the following words are used to
describe the actions of a YAML processor:

May
The word *may*, or the adjective
*optional*, mean that
conforming YAML processors
are permitted, but *need not*
behave as described.

Should
The word *should*, or the
adjective *recommended*,
mean that there could be reasons for a YAML processor to deviate from the
behavior described, but that such deviation could hurt
interoperability and should therefore be advertised with
appropriate notice.

Must
The word *must*, or the term
*required* or *shall*, mean that the behavior described
is an absolute requirement of the specification.

## Chapter 2. Preview

This section provides a quick glimpse into the expressive power of YAML.
It is not expected that the first-time reader grok all of the examples.
Rather, these selections are used as motivation for the remainder of the
specification.

## 2.1. Collections

YAML’s block collections use
indentation for scope
and begin each entry on its own line. Block
sequences indicate each entry with a dash and space (
“**`-`**”). Mappings use a colon and
space (“**`: `**”) to mark each mapping
key: value pair.

Example 2.1.
Sequence of Scalars

(ball players)

``` example
- Mark McGwire
- Sammy Sosa
- Ken Griffey
```

Example 2.2.
Mapping Scalars to Scalars

(player statistics)

``` example
hr:  65    # Home runs
avg: 0.278 # Batting average
rbi: 147   # Runs Batted In
```

Example 2.3.
Mapping Scalars to Sequences

(ball clubs in each league)

``` example
american:
  - Boston Red Sox
  - Detroit Tigers
  - New York Yankees
national:
  - New York Mets
  - Chicago Cubs
  - Atlanta Braves
```

Example 2.4.
Sequence of Mappings

(players’ statistics)

``` example
-
  name: Mark McGwire
  hr:   65
  avg:  0.278
-
  name: Sammy Sosa
  hr:   63
  avg:  0.288
```

YAML also has flow styles, using explicit indicators rather than indentation to denote scope.
The flow sequence is written as a comma separated list
within square brackets. In a similar manner, the flow
mapping uses curly braces.

**Example 2.5. Sequence of Sequences**

``` example
- [name        , hr, avg  ]
- [Mark McGwire, 65, 0.278]
- [Sammy Sosa  , 63, 0.288]
```

**Example 2.6. Mapping of Mappings**

``` example
Mark McGwire: {hr: 65, avg: 0.278}
Sammy Sosa: {
    hr: 63,
    avg: 0.288
  }
```

## 2.2. Structures

YAML uses three dashes (“**`---`**”) to separate documents
within a stream. Three dots ( “**`...`**”) indicate the end of
a document without starting a new one, for use in communication
channels. Comment lines begin with the Octothorpe (also called
“hash”, “sharp”, or “number
sign” - “**`#`**”).

Example 2.7.
Two Documents in a Stream

(each with a leading comment)

``` example
# Ranking of 1998 home runs
---
- Mark McGwire
- Sammy Sosa
- Ken Griffey

# Team ranking
---
- Chicago Cubs
- St Louis Cardinals
```

Example 2.8.
Play by Play Feed

from a Game

``` example
---
time: 20:03:20
player: Sammy Sosa
action: strike (miss)
...
---
time: 20:03:47
player: Sammy Sosa
action: grand slam
...
```

Repeated nodes are first identified by an anchor
(marked with the ampersand - “**`&`**”), and are then aliased
(referenced with an asterisk - “**`*`**”) thereafter.

Example 2.9.
Single Document with

Two Comments

``` example
---
hr: # 1998 hr ranking
  - Mark McGwire
  - Sammy Sosa
rbi:
  # 1998 rbi ranking
  - Sammy Sosa
  - Ken Griffey
```

Example 2.10.
Node for “Sammy Sosa”

appears twice in this document

``` example
---
hr:
  - Mark McGwire
  # Following node labeled SS
  - &SS Sammy Sosa
rbi:
  - *SS # Subsequent occurrence
  - Ken Griffey
```

A question mark and space (“**`? `**”) indicate a complex mapping key.
Within a block collection, key: value pairs can start
immediately following the dash, colon, or question mark.

**Example 2.11. Mapping between Sequences**

``` example
? - Detroit Tigers
  - Chicago cubs
:
  - 2001-07-23

? [ New York Yankees,
    Atlanta Braves ]
: [ 2001-07-02, 2001-08-12,
    2001-08-14 ]
```

**Example 2.12. In-Line Nested Mapping**

``` example
---
# products purchased
- item    : Super Hoop
  quantity: 1
- item    : Basketball
  quantity: 4
- item    : Big Shoes
  quantity: 1
```

## 2.3. Scalars

Scalar
content can be written in block form, using a literal
style (“**`|`**”) where all line breaks are significant.
Alternatively, they can be written with the folded
style (“**`>`**”) where each line break is folded to a space unless it ends an
empty or a “more indented”
line.

Example 2.13.
In literals,

newlines are preserved

``` example
# ASCII Art
--- |
  \//||\/||
  // ||  ||__
```

Example 2.14.
In the plain scalar,

newlines become spaces

``` example
---
  Mark McGwire's
  year was crippled
  by a knee injury.
```

Example 2.15.
Folded newlines are preserved

for "more indented" and blank lines

``` example
>
 Sammy Sosa completed another
 fine season with great stats.

   63 Home Runs
   0.288 Batting Average

 What a year!
```

Example 2.16.
Indentation determines scope



``` example
name: Mark McGwire
accomplishment: >
  Mark set a major league
  home run record in 1998.
stats: |
  65 Home Runs
  0.278 Batting Average
```

YAML’s flow scalars include the plain style (most
examples thus far) and quoted styles. The double-quoted style provides escape sequences.
The single-quoted style is useful when escaping is not
needed. All flow scalars can span
multiple lines; line
breaks are always folded.

**Example 2.17. Quoted Scalars**

``` example
unicode: "Sosa did fine.\u263A"
control: "\b1998\t1999\t2000\n"
hexesc:  "\x13\x10 is \r\n"

single: '"Howdy!" he cried.'
quoted: ' # not a ''comment''.'
tie-fighter: '|\-*-/|'
```

**Example 2.18. Multi-line Flow Scalars**

``` example
plain:
  This unquoted scalar
  spans many lines.

quoted: "So does this
  quoted scalar.\n"
```

## 2.4. Tags

In YAML, untagged nodes
are given an type depending on the application. The examples in this
specification generally use the /type/seq.html,
/type/map.html and
/type/str.html
types from the [/type/index.html](YAML tag
repository). A few examples also use the /type/int.html and
/type/float.html
types. The repository includes additional types such as /type/null.html,
/type/bool.html,
/type/set.html and
others.

**Example 2.19. Integers**

``` example
canonical: 12345
decimal: +12,345
sexagesimal: 3:25:45
octal: 014
hexadecimal: 0xC
```

**Example 2.20. Floating Point**

``` example
canonical: 1.23015e+3
exponential: 12.3015e+02
sexagesimal: 20:30.15
fixed: 1,230.15
negative infinity: -.inf
not a number: .NaN
```

**Example 2.21. Miscellaneous**

``` example
null: ~
true: y
false: n
string: '12345'
```

**Example 2.22. Timestamps**

``` example
canonical: 2001-12-15T02:59:43.1Z
iso8601: 2001-12-14t21:59:43.10-05:00
spaced: 2001-12-14 21:59:43.10 -5
date: 2002-12-14
```

Explicit typing is denoted with a tag using the exclamation
point (“**`!`**”) symbol. Global tags are URIs and may be
specified in a shorthand
form using a handle. Application-specific local tags may also be used.

**Example 2.23. Various Explicit Tags**

``` example
---
not-date: !!str 2002-04-28

picture: !!binary |
 R0lGODlhDAAMAIQAAP//9/X
 17unp5WZmZgAAAOfn515eXv
 Pz7Y6OjuDg4J+fn5OTk6enp
 56enmleECcgggoBADs=

application specific tag: !something |
 The semantics of the tag
 above may be different for
 different documents.
```

**Example 2.24. Global Tags**

``` example
%TAG ! tag:clarkevans.com,2002:
--- !shape
  # Use the ! handle for presenting
  # tag:clarkevans.com,2002:circle
- !circle
  center: &ORIGIN {x: 73, y: 129}
  radius: 7
- !line
  start: *ORIGIN
  finish: { x: 89, y: 102 }
- !label
  start: *ORIGIN
  color: 0xFFEEBB
  text: Pretty vector drawing.
```

**Example 2.25. Unordered Sets**

``` example
# sets are represented as a
# mapping where each key is
# associated with the empty string
--- !!set
? Mark McGwire
? Sammy Sosa
? Ken Griff
```

**Example 2.26. Ordered Mappings**

``` example
# ordered maps are represented as
# a sequence of mappings, with
# each mapping having one key
--- !!omap
- Mark McGwire: 65
- Sammy Sosa: 63
- Ken Griffy: 58
```

## Chapter 3. Processing YAML Information

YAML is both a text format and a method for presenting any data structure in this format.
Therefore, this specification defines two concepts: a class of data
objects called YAML representations, and a syntax for
presenting YAML representations as a series of
characters, called a YAML stream. A YAML *processor* is a tool for converting
information between these complementary views. It is assumed that a YAML
processor does its work on behalf of another module, called an *application*. This chapter describes the
information structures a YAML processor must provide to or obtain from
the application.

YAML information is used in two ways: for machine processing, and for
human consumption. The challenge of reconciling these two perspectives is
best done in three distinct translation stages: representation, serialization, and presentation. Representation
addresses how YAML
views native data structures to achieve portability between programming
environments. Serialization
concerns itself with turning a YAML representation into a serial form,
that is, a form with sequential access constraints. Presentation deals with the formatting
of a YAML serialization as a
series of characters in a human-friendly manner.

**Figure 3.1. Processing Overview**

!Processing Overview

A YAML processor need not expose the serialization or representation stages. It may
translate directly between native data structures and a character
stream
(*dump* and *load* in the diagram above). However, such a
direct translation should take place so that the native data structures
are constructed only from
information available in the representation.

## 3.1. Processes

This section details the processes shown in the diagram above. Note a
YAML processor need not provide
all these processes. For example, a YAML library may provide only YAML
input ability, for loading configuration files, or only output ability,
for sending data to other applications.

### 3.1.1. Represent

YAML *represents* any native
data structure using three node
kinds: sequence - an ordered series of entries; mapping -
an unordered association of unique keys to values; and
scalar - any datum with opaque structure presentable as a series of Unicode
characters. Combined, these primitives generate directed graph
structures. These primitives were chosen because they are both
powerful and familiar: the sequence corresponds to a
Perl array and a Python list, the mapping corresponds to a Perl
hash table and a Python dictionary. The scalar represents strings,
integers, dates, and other atomic data types.

Each YAML node requires, in addition to its kind and content, a tag specifying
its data type. Type specifiers are either global URIs, or are local in scope to a single application. For example, an
integer
is represented in YAML with a scalar plus the global tag
“**`tag:yaml.org,2002:int`**”. Similarly, an invoice object,
particular to a given organization, could be represented as a
mapping together with the local tag “**`!invoice`**”. This simple model
can represent any data structure independent of programming language.

### 3.1.2. Serialize

For sequential access mediums, such as an event callback API, a YAML
representation must be
*serialized* to an ordered tree.
Since in a YAML representation, mapping keys
are unordered and nodes may be referenced more than once (have more
than one incoming “arrow”), the serialization process is
required to impose an ordering
on the mapping
keys and to replace the second and subsequent references to
a given node with place holders called aliases. YAML
does not specify how these *serialization details* are chosen. It is up to the
YAML processor to come up with
human-friendly key order and
anchor names, possibly with the help of the application. The result of this
process, a YAML serialization
tree, can then be traversed to produce a series of event
calls for one-pass processing of YAML data.

### 3.1.3. Present

The final output process is *presenting* the YAML serializations as a character
stream in a human-friendly manner. To maximize human
readability, YAML offers a rich set of stylistic options which go
far beyond the minimal functional needs of simple data storage.
Therefore the YAML processor
is required to introduce various *presentation details* when creating the stream, such
as the choice of node styles, how
to format content, the amount of
indentation, which
tag handles to use, the
node
tags to leave unspecified, the set of directives to provide and
possibly even what comments to add. While some of this can be done with
the help of the application, in general this process
should be guided by the preferences of the user.

### 3.1.4. Parse

*Parsing* is the inverse process of
presentation, it takes a
stream of characters and produces a series of
events. Parsing discards all the details introduced in the presentation process, reporting only the
serialization events.
Parsing can fail due to ill-formed input.

### 3.1.5. Compose

*Composing* takes a series of
serialization events and
produces a representation
graph. Composing discards all the serialization details
introduced in the serialization process, producing only
the representation graph.
Composing can fail due to any of several reasons, detailed below.

### 3.1.6. Construct

The final input process is *constructing* native data structures
from the YAML representation. Construction must
be based only on the information available in the representation, and not on
additional serialization
or presentation
details such as comments, directives, mapping key
order, node styles,
content format, indentation levels etc.
Construction can fail due to the unavailability of the required native data types.

## 3.2. Information Models

This section specifies the formal details of the results of the above
processes. To maximize data portability between programming languages
and implementations, users of YAML should be mindful of the distinction
between serialization or
presentation properties and
those which are part of the YAML representation. Thus, while imposing
a order on mapping keys is
necessary for flattening YAML representations to a sequential
access medium, this serialization detail must not be used to convey
application level information.
In a similar manner, while indentation technique and a choice of a node style are needed for the human
readability, these presentation
details are neither part of the YAML serialization nor the YAML representation. By carefully
separating properties needed for serialization and presentation, YAML representations of application information will be
consistent and portable between various programming environments.

The following diagram summarizes the three information models. Full
arrows denote composition, hollow arrows denote inheritance,
“**`1`**” and “**`*`**” denote “one” and
“many” relationships. A single “**`+`**” denotes
serialization details, a
double “**`++`**” denotes presentation details.

**Figure 3.2. Information Models**

!Information Models

### 3.2.1. Representation Graph

YAML’s *representation*
of native data is a rooted, connected, directed graph of tagged nodes. By
“directed graph” we mean a set of nodes and
directed edges (“arrows”), where each edge connects one
node
to another (see [http://www.nist.gov/dads/HTML/directedGraph.html](a formal
definition)). All the nodes must be reachable from
the *root node* via such edges.
Note that the YAML graph may include cycles, and a node may have
more than one incoming edge.

Nodes
that are defined in terms of other nodes are collections and nodes that are independent of
any other nodes are scalars. YAML supports two
kinds of collection
nodes, sequences and mappings. Mapping
nodes are somewhat tricky because their keys are
unordered and must be unique.

**Figure 3.3. Representation Model**

!Representation Model

#### 3.2.1.1. Nodes

YAML *nodes* have *content* of one of three
*kinds*: scalar, sequence, or
mapping. In addition, each node has a tag which serves to
restrict the set of possible values which the node’s content can
have.

Scalar
The content of a *scalar* node is an
opaque datum that can be presented as a series of zero or
more Unicode characters.

Sequence
The content of a *sequence* node is an
ordered series of zero or more nodes. In particular, a sequence
may contain the same node more than once or it could even
contain itself (directly or indirectly).

Mapping
The content of a *mapping* node is an
unordered set of *key:* *value* node pairs, with
the restriction that each of the keys is unique. YAML places no further
restrictions on the nodes. In particular, keys may be arbitrary
nodes, the same node may be used as the value of several
key: value pairs, and a mapping could even contain itself
as a key or a value (directly or indirectly).

When appropriate, it is convenient to consider sequences and
mappings together, as *collections*. In this view,
sequences are treated as mappings with integer keys starting at
zero. Having a unified collections view for sequences and mappings
is helpful both for creating practical YAML tools and APIs and for
theoretical analysis.

#### 3.2.1.2. Tags

YAML represents type
information of native data structures with a simple identifier,
called a *tag*. *Global
tags* are http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt and hence
globally unique across all applications. The
“**`tag`**”: [http://www.taguri.org](URI
scheme) (/spec/taguri.txt) is
recommended for all global YAML tags. In contrast, *local tags* are specific to a single
application. Local tags
start with *“**`!`**”*, are not URIs and are not
expected to be globally unique. YAML provides a “**`TAG`**” directive to
make tag notation less verbose; it also offers easy migration from
local to global tags. To ensure this, local tags are restricted to
the URI character set and use URI character escaping.

YAML does not mandate any special relationship between different
tags that begin with the same substring. Tags ending with URI
fragments (containing “**`#`**”) are no exception; tags that
share the same base URI but differ in their fragment part are
considered to be different, independent tags. By convention,
fragments are used to identify different “variants” of
a tag, while “**`/`**” is used to define nested tag
“namespace” hierarchies. However, this is merely a
convention, and each tag may employ its own rules. For example,
Perl tags may use “**`::`**” to express namespace
hierarchies, Java tags may use “**`.`**”, etc.

YAML tags are used to associate meta information with each node. In
particular, each tag must specify the expected node kind (scalar, sequence, or mapping). Scalar
tags must also provide mechanism for converting formatted content to a canonical form for supporting
equality testing.
Furthermore, a tag may provide additional information such as the
set of allowed content values for validation, a mechanism for
tag resolution, or any
other data that is applicable to all of the tag’s nodes.

#### 3.2.1.3. Nodes Comparison

Since YAML mappings require key uniqueness, representations must include a
mechanism for testing the equality of nodes. This is non-trivial
since YAML allows various ways to format a given scalar content. For
example, the integer eleven can be written as “**`013`**”
(octal) or “**`0xB`**” (hexadecimal). If both forms are
used as keys in the same mapping, only a YAML
processor which recognizes
integer formats would correctly
flag the duplicate key as an error.

Canonical Form
YAML supports the need for scalar equality by
requiring that every scalartag must
specify a mechanism to producing the *canonical form* of any
formatted content. This
form is a Unicode character string which presents the content and can be used for equality testing.
While this requirement is stronger than a well defined equality
operator, it has other uses, such as the production of digital
signatures.

Equality
Two nodes must have the same tag and
content to be *equal*. Since each tag
applies to exactly one kind,
this implies that the two nodes must have the
same kind to be equal. Two
scalars are equal only when their tags and
canonical forms are equal character-by-character. Equality of
collections is defined recursively. Two
sequences are equal only when they have the
same tag and length, and each node in
one sequence is equal to the corresponding
node in the other sequence. Two mappings are equal only when they have the
same tag and an equal set of keys,
and each key in this set is associated with equal
values in both mappings.

Identity
Two nodes are *identical* only when they represent the same native data
structure. Typically, this corresponds to a single memory
address. Identity should not be confused with equality; two
equal nodes need not have the same identity. A YAML
processor may treat
equal scalars as if they were identical. In
contrast, the separate identity of two distinct but equal
collections must be preserved.

### 3.2.2. Serialization Tree

To express a YAML representation using a serial API,
it necessary to impose an order on mapping keys and employ
alias
nodes to indicate a subsequent occurrence of a previously
encountered node. The result of this process is a *serialization tree*, where each
node
has an ordered set of children. This tree can be traversed for a
serial event-based API. Construction of native structures from
the serial interface should not use key
order or anchors for the preservation of important data.

**Figure 3.4. Serialization Model**

!Serialization Model

#### 3.2.2.1. Keys Order

In the representation
model, mapping
keys do not have an order. To serialize a mapping,
it is necessary to impose an *ordering* on its keys. This order is a
serialization
detail and should not be used when composing the representation graph (and hence
for the preservation of important data). In every case where
node order is significant, a sequence
must be used. For example, an ordered mapping can be represented as a sequence
of mappings, where each mapping is a single
key: value pair. YAML provides
convenient compact notation for this case.

#### 3.2.2.2. Anchors and Aliases

In the representation
graph, a node may appear in more than one collection. When serializing such data, the first
occurrence of the node is *identified* by an *anchor* and
each subsequent occurrence is serialized as an *alias node*
which refers back to this anchor. Otherwise, anchor names are a
serialization
detail and are discarded once composing is completed. When composing a representation graph from
serialized events, an alias
node refers to the most recent node in the serialization having the
specified anchor. Therefore, anchors need not be unique within a
serialization. In
addition, an anchor need not have an alias node referring to it. It
is therefore possible to provide an anchor for all nodes in
serialization.

### 3.2.3. Presentation Stream

A YAML *presentation* is a
*stream* of Unicode characters making use of of
styles, formats, comments, directives and other presentation details to present a YAML serialization in a human readable
way. Although a YAML processor
may provide these details when parsing, they should not be reflected in
the resulting serialization. YAML allows several
serializations to be
contained in the same YAML character stream as a series of *documents*
separated by document
boundary markers. Documents appearing in the same stream
are independent; that is, a node must not appear in more
than one serialization
tree or representation
graph.

**Figure 3.5. Presentation Model**

!Presentation Model

#### 3.2.3.1. Node Styles

Each node is presented in some *style*, depending on its kind. The node style is a presentation detail and is
not reflected in the serialization
tree or representation
graph. There are two groups of styles, *block*
and *flow*. Block styles use indentation to denote nesting
and scope within the document. In contrast, flow
styles rely on explicit indicators to denote nesting and
scope.

YAML provides a rich set of scalar styles. *Block
scalar styles* include the *literal style* and
the *folded style*; *flow scalar styles* include
the *plain style* and two *quoted styles*, the
*single-quoted style* and the *double-quoted style*. These styles offer a range of
trade-offs between expressive power and readability.

Normally, the content of *block collections*
begins on the next line. In most cases, YAML also allows block
collections to start *in-line* for more compact
notation when nesting *block sequences* and
*block mappings* inside each other. When nesting
*flow collections*, a *flow mapping* with a
*single key: value pair* may be specified
directly inside a *flow sequence*, allowing for
a compact “ordered mapping” notation.

**Figure 3.6. Kind/Style Combinations**

!Kind/Style Combinations

#### 3.2.3.2. Scalar Formats

YAML allows scalar content to be presented in several *formats*. For example, the boolean
“**`true`**” might also be written as
“**`yes`**”. Tags must specify a mechanism for converting any
formatted scalar content to a canonical form for use in equality testing. Like node style, the format is a
presentation detail and is
not reflected in the serialization
tree and representation
graph.

#### 3.2.3.3. Comments

*Comments* are a presentation detail and must not have any effect
on the serialization
tree or representation
graph. In particular, comments are not associated with a
particular node. The usual purpose of a comment is to
communicate between the human maintainers of a file. A typical
example is comments in a configuration file. Comments may not
appear inside scalars, but may be interleaved with such scalars
inside collections.

#### 3.2.3.4. Directives

Each document may be associated with a set of *directives*. A directive has a name and an optional
sequence of parameters. Directives are instructions to the YAML
processor, and like all
other presentation
details are not reflected in the YAML serialization tree or representation graph. This
version of YAML defines a two directives, “**`YAML`**” and “**`TAG`**”. All other
directives are reserved for future versions of YAML.

## 3.3. Loading Failure Points

The process of loading native data
structures from a YAML stream has several potential *failure points*. The character stream may be
ill-formed, aliases may be
unidentified, unspecified tags may be unresolvable, tags may be unrecognized, the content may
be invalid, and a native
type may be unavailable.
Each of these failures results with an incomplete loading.

A *partial
representation* need not resolve the tag of each node, and the
canonical form of scalar content
need not be available. This weaker representation is useful for cases
of incomplete knowledge of the types used in the document. In
contrast, a *complete
representation* specifies the tag of each node, and
provides the canonical form
of scalar
content, allowing for equality testing. A complete
representation is required in order to construct native data structures.

**Figure 3.7. Loading Failure Points**

!Loading Failure Points

### 3.3.1. Well-Formed and Identified

A *well-formed*
character stream must match the productions specified in the
next chapter. Successful loading also requires that each alias shall
refer to a previous node identified by the anchor. A
YAML processor should reject
*ill-formed streams* and
*unidentified aliases*.
A YAML processor may recover
from syntax errors, possibly by ignoring certain parts of the input,
but it must provide a mechanism for reporting such errors.

### 3.3.2. Resolved

It is not required that all the tags of the complete representation
be explicitly specified in the character stream. During parsing, nodes that omit the tag are given a
*non-specific tag*:
*“**`?`**”*
for plain scalars and *“**`!`**”* for all other nodes. These
non-specific tags must be *resolved* to a *specific tag* (either a local tag or a global
tag) for a complete representation to be composed.

Resolving the tag of a node must only depend on the
following three parameters: the non-specific tag of the node, the path
leading from the root node to
the node, and the content (and hence the
kind) of the node. In
particular, resolution must not consider presentation details such as
comments, indentation and node
style. Also, resolution must not consider the content of
any other node, except for the content of the key nodes
directly along the path leading from the root node to the resolved node. In particular,
resolution must not consider the content of a sibling node in a
collection or the content of the value node
associated with a resolved key node.

Tag resolution is specific to the application, hence a YAML processor should provide a mechanism
allowing the application to
specify the tag resolution rules. It is recommended that nodes having
the “**`!`**” non-specific tag should be resolved as
“**`tag:yaml.org,2002:seq`**”,
“**`tag:yaml.org,2002:map`**” or
“**`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**” depending on the node’s
kind. This convention allows the author of a YAML character
stream to exert some measure of control over the tag
resolution process. By explicitly specifying a plain
scalar has the “**`!`**” non-specific tag, the
node
is resolved as a string, as if it was quoted or written in a
block
style. Note, however, that each application may override this
behavior. For example, an application may automatically detect
the type of programming language used in source code presented as a non-plain
scalar and resolve it accordingly.

When a node has more than one occurrence (using an anchor and
alias
nodes), tag resolution must depend only on the path to the
first occurrence of the node. Typically, the path leading to a node is
sufficient to determine its specific tag. In cases where the path
does not imply a single specific tag, the resolution also needs to
consider the node content to select amongst the set of possible
tags.
Thus, plain scalars may be matched against a set of
regular expressions to provide automatic resolution of integers,
floats, timestamps, and similar types. Similarly, the content of
mapping
nodes may be matched against sets of expected keys to
automatically resolve points, complex numbers, and similar types.

The combined effect of these rules is to ensure that tag resolution
can be performed as soon as a node is first encountered in
the stream, typically before its content is
parsed. Also, tag resolution only
requires referring to a relatively small number of previously parsed
nodes. Thus, tag resolution in one-pass processors is both possible and
practical.

If a document contains *unresolved tags*, the YAML processor is unable to compose a complete representation graph. In
such a
case, the YAML processor may
compose an partial representation,
based on each node’s kind and
allowing for non-specific tags.

### 3.3.3. Recognized and Valid

To be *valid*, a node must have
a tag
which is *recognized* by
the YAML processor and its
content must satisfy the constraints imposed by this
tag.
If a document contains a scalar node with an *unrecognized tag* or *invalid content*, only a partial representation may
be composed. In contrast, a YAML
processor can always compose a complete representation for an unrecognized
or an invalid collection, since collection equality does not depend upon knowledge
of the collection’s data type. However, such a complete representation
can not be used to construct a
native data structure.

### 3.3.4. Available

In a given processing environment, there need not be an *available* native type corresponding
to a given tag. If a node’s tag is *unavailable*, a YAML processor will not be able to construct a native data
structure for
it. In this case, a complete representation may still be
composed, and an application may wish to use this
representation directly.

## Chapter 4. Productions Conventions

The following chapters describe the syntax of YAML character streams in detail using a
series of BNF productions. In most cases, productions are introduced in a
“bottom-up” order; basic productions are specified before
the more complex productions using them. Examples accompanying the
productions display sample YAML text side-by-side with equivalent YAML
text using only flow collections and double-quoted
scalars. For improved readability, the equivalent YAML text
uses the “**`!!seq`**”, “**`!!map`**”, and
“**`!!str`**” shorthands instead of the verbatim “**`!`**”,
“**`!`**” and
“**`!`**” forms. These types are
used to resolve all untagged nodes, except for a few
examples that use the “**`!!int`**” and “**`!!float`**”
types.

## 4.1. Production Prefixes

To make the syntax easier to follow, production names use
Hungarian-style notation. Each production is given one of the following
prefix based on the type of characters it matches.

**`e-`**
A production matching no characters.

**`c-`**
A production matching one or more characters starting and ending
with a special (non-space) character.

**`b-`**
A production matching a single line break.

**`nb-`**
A production matching one or more characters starting and ending
with a non-break
character.

**`s-`**
A production matching one or more characters starting and ending
with a space character.

**`ns-`**
A production matching one or more characters starting and ending
with a non-space character.

`X`**`-`**`Y`**`-`**
A production matching a sequence of one or more characters,
starting with an `X`**`-`**
character and ending with a
`Y`**`-`** character.

**`l-`**
A production matching one or more lines (shorthand for
**`s-b-`**).

`X`**`+`**,
`X`**`-`**`Y`**`+`**
A production as above, with the additional property that the
indentation level
used is greater than the specified `n` parameter.

## 4.2. Production Parameters

As YAML’s syntax is designed for maximal readability, it makes heavy
use of the context that each syntactical entity appears in. For
notational compactness, this is expressed using parameterized BNF
productions. The set of parameters and the range of allowed values
depend on the specific production. The full list of possible parameters
and their values is:

Indentation: `n` or `m`
Since the character stream depends upon indentation level to
delineate blocks, many productions are parameterized by it. In some
cases, the notations “**`production(<n)`**”,
“**`production(≤n)`**” and
“**`production(>n)`**” are used; these are shorthands
for “**`production(m)`**” for some specific
`m` where 0 ≤ `m` \< `n`,
0 ≤ `m` ≤ `n` and
`m` \> `n`,
respectively.

Context: `c`
YAML supports two groups of *contexts*, distinguishing between
block
styles and flow styles. In the block styles,
indentation is used
to delineate structure. Due to the fact that the “**`-`**”
character denoting a block sequence entry is perceived as
an indentation
character, some productions distinguish between the block-in context (inside a
block
sequence) and the block-out context (outside one). In the flow styles,
explicit indicators are used
to delineate structure. As plain scalars have no such indicators, they are the most context
sensitive, distinguishing between being nested inside a flow
collection (flow-in context) or being outside one (flow-out context). YAML also
provides a terse and intuitive syntax for simple keys. Plain scalars in this (flow-key) context are the most
restricted, for readability and implementation reasons.

(Scalar) Style: `s`
Scalar
content may be presented in one of five styles: the plain, double-quoted and single-quotedflow styles, and the literal
and
foldedblock
styles.

(Block) Chomping: `t`
Block scalars offer three possible mechanisms for chomping any trailing line breaks: strip, clip and keep.

## Chapter 5. Characters

## 5.1. Character Set

YAML streams
use the *printable*
subset of the Unicode character set. On input, a YAML processor must accept all printable
ASCII characters, the space, tab,
line break, and all
Unicode characters beyond \#x9F. On output, a YAML processor must only produce these
acceptable characters, and should also escape all non-printable Unicode
characters. The allowed character range explicitly excludes the
surrogate block **`#xD800-#xDFFF`**, DEL
**`#x7F`**, the C0 control block
**`#x0-#x1F`** (except for
**`#x9`**, **`#xA`**, and
**`#xD`**), the C1 control block
**`#x80-#x9F`**, **`#xFFFE`**, and
**`#xFFFF`**. Any such characters must be presented using escape sequences.

[1]

c-printable

::=

  #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#x7E]
      /* 8 bit */

| #x85 | [#xA0-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] /* 16 bit */

| [#x10000-#x10FFFF]
         &#10;    /* 32 bit */

## 5.2. Character Encoding

All characters mentioned in this specification are Unicode code
points. Each such code point is written as one or more octets
depending on the *character
encoding* used. Note that in UTF-16, characters above
**`#xFFFF`** are written as four octets, using a
surrogate pair. A YAML processor must support the UTF-16 and
UTF-8 character encodings. If a character stream does not begin with a *byte order mark*
(**`#FEFF`**), the character encoding shall be
UTF-8. Otherwise it shall be either UTF-8, UTF-16 LE, or UTF-16 BE as
indicated by the byte order mark. On output, it is recommended that a
byte order mark should only be emitted for UTF-16 character
encodings. Note that the UTF-32 encoding is explicitly not supported.
For more information about the byte order mark and the Unicode
character encoding schemes see the Unicode http://www.unicode.org/unicode/faq/utf_bom.html.

``` example
%YAML 1.1

  ? !!str "single"
  : !!str "text",

```

- A “**`%`**”
  (**`#25`**, percent) denotes a directive line.

[19]

c-directive

::=

“%”

**Example 5.9. Directive Indicator**

``` example

| #c-folded
| #c-single-quote
| #c-double-quote

| #c-directive
| [#c-reserved](“@”
| “`”)

## 5.4. Line Break Characters

The Unicode standard defines the following *line break* characters:

[22]

b-line-feed

::=

xA /*LF*/

[23]

b-carriage-return

::=

xD /*CR*/

[24]

b-next-line

::=

x85 /*NEL*/

[25]

b-line-separator

::=

x2028 /*LS*/

[26]

b-paragraph-separator

::=

x2029 /*PS*/

A YAML processor must accept
all the possible Unicode line break characters.

[27]

b-char

::=

  #b-line-feed
| #b-carriage-return
| #b-next-line

| #b-line-separator
| #b-paragraph-separator

Line breaks can be grouped into two categories. *Specific line breaks* have
well-defined semantics for breaking text into lines and paragraphs,
and must be preserved by the YAML processor inside scalar content.

[28]

b-specific

::=

b-line-separator
| #b-paragraph-separator

*Generic line breaks*
do not carry a meaning beyond “ending a line”. Unlike
specific line breaks, there are several widely used forms for generic
line breaks.

[29]

b-generic

::=

  ( #b-carriage-return
b-line-feed ) /* DOS, Windows */

| #b-carriage-return
         &#10;      /* Macintosh */

| #b-line-feed
         &#10;
  /* UNIX */

| #b-next-line
         &#10;
  /* Unicode */

Generic line breaks inside scalar content must be *normalized* by the YAML
processor. Each such line
break must be parsed into a single
line feed character. The original line break form is a presentation detail and must
not be used to convey content information.

[30]

b-as-line-feed

::=

b-generic

[31]

b-normalized

::=

b-as-line-feed
| #b-specific

Normalization does not apply to ignored (escaped%20line%20break/) or chomped) generic line breaks.

[32]

b-ignored-generic

::=

b-generic

Outside scalar
content, YAML allows any line break to be used to terminate
lines.

[33]

b-ignored-any

::=

b-generic
| #b-specific

On output, a YAML processor is
free to present line breaks using
whatever convention is most appropriate, though specific line breaks
must be preserved in scalar content. These rules are compatible
with http://www.unicode.org/unicode/reports/tr13/.

In the examples, line break characters are displayed as follows:
“**`↓`**” or no glyph for a generic line break,
“**`⇓`**” for a line separator and
“**`¶`**” for a paragraph separator.

**Example 5.11. Line Break Characters**

``` example
|
  Generic line break (no glyph)
  Generic line break (glyphed)↓
  Line separator⇓
  Paragraph separator¶
```
``` example
Legend:
  b-generic b-line-separator
  b-paragraph-separator
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
--- !!str
"Generic line break (no glyph)\n\
 Generic line break (glyphed)\n\
 Line separator\u2028\
 Paragraph separator\u2029"
```

## 5.5. Miscellaneous Characters

The YAML syntax productions make use of the following character range
definitions:

- A non-break
  character:

[34]

nb-char

::=

c-printable
- #b-char

- An ignored space character outside scalar content. Such spaces are used
  for indentation and
  separation between
  tokens. To maintain portability, *tab* characters must not be used in these
  cases, since different systems treat tabs differently. Note that
  most modern editors may be configured so that pressing the tab key
  results in the insertion of an appropriate number of spaces.

[35]

s-ignored-space

::=

x20 /*SP*/

**Example 5.12. Invalid Use of Tabs**

``` example
# Tabs do's and don'ts:
# comment: →
quoted: "Quoted →"
block: |
  void main() {
  →printf("Hello, world!\n");
  }
elsewhere:→# separation
→indentation, in→plain scalar
```

``` example
ERROR:
 Tabs may appear inside
 comments and quoted or
 block scalar content.
 Tabs must not appear
 elsewhere, such as
 in indentation and
 separation spaces.
```

- A *white space* character in
  quoted
  or block
  scalar content:

[36]

s-white

::=

x9 /*TAB*/ | #x20 /*SP*/

In the examples, tab characters are displayed as the glyph
“**`→`**”. Space characters are sometimes displayed as
the glyph “**`·`**” for clarity.

**Example 5.13. Tabs and Spaces**

``` example
··"Text·containing···
··both·space·and→
··→tab→characters"
```
``` example
Legend:
  #x9 (TAB) #x20 (SP)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
--- !!str
"Text·containing·\
 both·space·and·\
 tab→characters"
```

- An ignored white space character inside scalar content:

[37]

s-ignored-white

::=

s-white

- A non space (and non-break) character:

[38]

ns-char

::=

nb-char - #s-white

- A decimal digit for numbers:

[39]

ns-dec-digit

::=

[#x30-#x39] /*0-9*/

- A hexadecimal digit for escape sequences:

[40]

ns-hex-digit

::=

ns-dec-digit
| [#x41-#x46] /*A-F*/ | [#x61-#x66] /*a-f*/

- An ASCII letter (alphabetic) character:

[41]

ns-ascii-letter

::=

[#x41-#x5A] /*A-Z*/ | [#x61-#x7A] /*a-z*/

- A word (alphanumeric) character for identifiers:

[42]

ns-word-char

::=

ns-dec-digit
| #ns-ascii-letter
| “-”

- A URI character for tags, as specified in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt with the
  addition of the “**`[`**” and [“**`]`**”](#%5D%20end%20flow%20sequence/) for presenting IPv6
  addresses as proposed in http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt. A
  limited form of 8-bit *escaping* is available using the *“**`%`**”* character. By
  convention, URIs containing 16 and 32 bit Unicode characters are
  encoded in UTF-8,
  and then each octet is written as a separate character.

[43]

ns-uri-char

::=

  #ns-word-char
| “%” #ns-hex-digit
ns-hex-digit

| “;” | “/” | “?”
| “:” | “@” | “&amp;”
| “=” | “+” | “$”
| “,”

| “_” | “.” | “!”
| “~” | “*” | “'”
| “(” | “)” | “[”
| “]”

- The “**`!`**”
  character is used to indicate the end of a named tag handle; hence its use in tag shorthands is restricted.

[44]

ns-tag-char

::=

ns-uri-char
- #c-tag

## 5.6. Escape Sequences

All non-printable
characters must be presented as
*escape
sequences*. Each escape sequences must be parsed into the appropriate Unicode
character. The original escape sequence form is a presentation detail and must
not be used to convey content information. YAML
escape sequences use the *“**`\`**”* notation common to
most modern computer languages. Note that escape sequences are only
interpreted in double-quoted scalars. In all other
scalar styles,
the “**`\`**” character has no special meaning
and non-printable
characters are not available.

[45]

c-escape

::=

“\”

YAML escape sequences are a superset of C’s escape sequences:

- Escaped ASCII null (**`#x0`**) character:

[46]

ns-esc-null

::=

c-escape
“0”

- Escaped ASCII bell (**`#x7`**) character:

- Escaped ASCII double quote (“**`"`**”):

[56]

ns-esc-double-quote

::=

c-escape

  character:

[59]

ns-esc-non-breaking-space

- Escaped Unicode line
  separator (**`#x2028`**) character:

[60]

ns-esc-line-separator

::=

c-escape
“L”

- Escaped Unicode paragraph
  separator (**`#x2029`**) character:

[61]

ns-esc-paragraph-separator

::=

c-escape
“P”

- Escaped 8-bit Unicode character:

[62]

ns-esc-8-bit

::=

c-escape
“x” ( #ns-hex-digit x 2 )

- Escaped 16-bit Unicode character:

[63]

ns-esc-16-bit

::=

c-escape
“u” ( #ns-hex-digit x 4 )

- Escaped 32-bit Unicode character:

[64]

ns-esc-32-bit

::=

c-escape
“U” ( #ns-hex-digit x 8 )

- Any escaped character:

[65]

ns-esc-char

::=

## Chapter 6. Syntax Primitives

## 6.1. Indentation Spaces

In a YAML character stream, structure is often determined
from *indentation*,
where indentation is defined as a line break character (or the start of the
stream)
followed by zero or more space characters. Note that indentation must
not contain any tab characters. The
amount of indentation is a presentation detail used exclusively to delineate
structure and is otherwise ignored. In particular, indentation
characters must never be considered part of a node’s content
information.

[66]

s-indent(n)

::=

s-ignored-space x n

**Example 6.1. Indentation Spaces**

``` example
··# Leading comment line spaces are
···# neither content nor indentation.
····
Not indented:
·By one space: |
····By four
······spaces
·Flow style: [    # Leading spaces
···By two,        # in flow style
··Also by two,    # are neither
··→Still by two   # content nor
····]             # indentation.
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-indent(n) Content
  Neither content nor indentation
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "Not indented"
  : !!map {
      ? !!str "By one space"
      : !!str "By four\n  spaces\n",
      ? !!str "Flow style"
      : !!seq [
          !!str "By two",
          !!str "Still by two",
          !!str "Again by two",
        ]
    }
}
```

In general, a node
must be indented further than its parent node. All sibling nodes must use the exact same indentation
level, however the content of each sibling node may be further
indented independently. The “**`-`**”, “**`?`**” and “**`:`**” characters used to denote block
collection entries are perceived by people to be part of the
indentation. Hence the indentation rules are slightly more flexible
when dealing with these indicators. First, a block
sequence need not be indented relative to its parent node, unless that node is also a block
sequence. Second, compact in-line notations allow a nested collection to begin
immediately following the indicator (where the indicator is counted as part of the
indentation). This provides for an intuitive collection nesting
syntax.

## 6.2. Comments

An explicit *comment* is marked by a *“**`#`**” indicator*. Comments
are a presentation
detail and must have no effect on the serialization tree (and hence the
representation graph).

[67]

c-nb-comment-text

::=

c-comment
nb-char*

Comments always span to the end of the line.

[68]

c-b-comment

::=

c-nb-comment-text?
b-ignored-any

Outside scalar
content, comments may appear on a line of their own,
independent of the indentation level. Note that tab characters must not be used and that
empty lines outside scalar content are
taken to be (empty) comment lines.

[69]

l-comment

::=

s-ignored-space*
c-b-comment

**Example 6.2. Comment Lines**

``` example
··# Comment↓
···↓
↓
```

``` example
# This stream contains no
# documents, only comments.
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-b-comment l-comment
```

When a comment follows another syntax element, it must be separated from it by space
characters. Like the comment itself, such characters are not
considered part of the content information.

[70]

s-b-comment

::=

( #s-ignored-space+
c-nb-comment-text? )?

b-ignored-any

**Example 6.3. Comments Ending a Line**

``` example
key:····# Comment↓
  value↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-nb-comment-text s-b-comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "key"
  : !!str "value"
}
```

In most cases, when a line may end with a comment, YAML allows it to
be followed by additional comment lines.

[71]

c-l-comments

::=

c-b-comment
l-comment*

[72]

s-l-comments

::=

s-b-comment
l-comment*

**Example 6.4. Multi-Line Comments**

``` example
key:····# Comment↓
········# lines↓
  value↓
↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-b-comment l-comment s-l-comments
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "key"
  : !!str "value"
}
```

## 6.3. Separation Spaces

Outside scalar
content, YAML uses space characters for *separation* between tokens. Note
that separation must not contain tab
characters. Separation spaces are a presentation detail used exclusively to delineate
structure and are otherwise ignored; in particular, such characters
must never be considered part of a node’s content information.

[73]

s-separate(n,c)

::=

c = block-out ⇒
s-separate-lines(n))

c = block-in  ⇒
s-separate-lines(n))

c = flow-out  ⇒
s-separate-lines(n))

c = flow-in   ⇒
s-separate-lines(n))

c = flow-key  ⇒
s-separate-spaces

- YAML usually allows separation spaces to include a comment ending the
  line and additional comment lines. Note that the token
  following the separation comment lines must be properly
  indented, even
  though there is no such restriction on the separation comment lines
  themselves.

[74]

s-separate-lines(n)

::=

  #s-ignored-space+

| ( #s-l-comments
s-indent(n))
s-ignored-space* )

- Inside simple keys,
  however, separation spaces are confined to the current line.

[75]

s-separate-spaces

::=

s-ignored-space+

**Example 6.5. Separation Spaces**

``` example
{·first:·Sammy,·last:·Sosa·}:↓
# Statistics:
··hr:··# Home runs
····65
··avg:·# Average
····0.278
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-separate-spaces
  s-separate-lines(n)
  s-indent(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!map {
    ? !!str "first"
    : !!str "Sammy",
    ? !!str "last"
    : !!str "Sosa"
  }
  : !!map {
    ? !!str "hr"
    : !!int "65",
    ? !!str "avg"
    : !!float "0.278"
  }
}
```

## 6.4. Ignored Line Prefix

YAML discards the “empty” *prefix* of each scalar content line. This prefix always
includes the indentation, and depending on the scalar style may
also include all leading white
space. The ignored prefix is a presentation detail and must
never be considered part of a node’s content
information.

[76]

s-ignored-prefix(n,s)

::=

s = plain   ⇒
s-ignored-prefix-plain(n))

s = double  ⇒
s-ignored-prefix-quoted(n))

s = single  ⇒
s-ignored-prefix-quoted(n))

s = literal ⇒
s-ignored-prefix-block(n))

s = folded  ⇒
s-ignored-prefix-block(n))

- Plain scalars must not contain any tab characters, and all leading spaces are
  always discarded.

[77]

s-ignored-prefix-plain(n)

::=

s-indent(n))
s-ignored-space*

- Quoted scalars may contain tab
  characters. Again, all leading white
  space is always discarded.

[78]

s-ignored-prefix-quoted(n)

::=

s-indent(n))
s-ignored-white*

- Block scalars rely on indentation; hence leading white space, if any, is not discarded.

[79]

s-ignored-prefix-block(n)

::=

s-indent(n))

**Example 6.6. Ignored Prefix**

``` example
plain: text
··lines
quoted: "text
··→lines"
block: |
··text
···→lines
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-ignored-prefix-plain(n)
  s-ignored-prefix-quoted(n)
  s-ignored-prefix-block(n)
  s-indent(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "plain"
  : !!str "text lines",
  ? !!str "quoted"
  : !!str "text lines",
  ? !!str "block"
  : !!str "text·→lines\n"
}
```

An *empty line* line consists
of the ignored prefix followed by a line break. When trailing block
scalars, such lines can also be interpreted as (empty)
comment
lines. YAML provides a chomping
mechanism to resolve this ambiguity.

[80]

l-empty(n,s)

::=

( #s-indent(n))
| #s-ignored-prefix(n,s)) )

b-normalized

**Example 6.7. Empty Lines**

``` example
- foo
·↓
  bar
- |-
  foo
·↓
  bar
··↓
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq {
  !!str "foo\nbar",
  !!str "foo\n\nbar"
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-empty(n,s)
  l-comment
```

## 6.5. Line Folding

*Line folding* allows long
lines to be broken for readability, while retaining the original
semantics of a single long line. When folding is done, any line break ending an
empty line is preserved. In
addition, any specific line
breaks are also preserved, even when ending a non-empty line.

[81]

b-l-folded-specific(n,s)

::=

b-specific
l-empty(n,s))*

Hence, folding only applies to generic line breaks that end non-empty lines. If the following line is
also not empty, the generic line break is
converted to a single space (**`#x20`**).

[82]

b-l-folded-as-space

::=

b-generic

If the following line is empty
line, the generic
line break is ignored.

[83]

b-l-folded-trimmed(n,s)

::=

b-ignored-generic
l-empty(n,s))+

Thus, a folded non-empty line
may end with one of three possible folded line break forms. The
original form of such a folded line break is a presentation detail and must
not be used to convey node’s content
information.

[84]

b-l-folded-any(n,s)

::=

  #b-l-folded-specific(n,s))

| #b-l-folded-as-space

| #b-l-folded-trimmed(n,s))

**Example 6.8. Line Folding**

``` example
>-
  specific⇓
  trimmed↓
··↓
·↓
↓
  as↓
  space
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
--- !!str
"specific\L\
 trimmed\n\n\n\
 as space"
```
``` example
Legend:
  b-l-folded-specific(n,s)
  b-l-folded-trimmed(n,s)
  b-l-folded-as-space
```

The above rules are common to both the folded block style and the scalar flow
styles. Folding does distinguish between the folded block style
and the scalar
flow styles in the following way:

Block Folding
In the folded
block style, folding does not apply to line breaks or empty lines that precede or follow a
text line containing leading white
space. Note that such a line may consist of only such
leading white space; an
emptyblock line is
confined to (optional) indentation spaces only. Further, the final
line break and
empty lines are subject to
chomping, and are never
folded. The combined effect of these rules is that each
“paragraph” is interpreted as a line, empty lines are used to present a line feed, the formatting of
“more indented”
lines is preserved, and final line breaks may be included or excluded
from the node’s content information as appropriate.

Flow Folding
Folding in flow
styles provides more relaxed, less powerful semantics.
Flow
styles typically depend on explicit indicators to convey structure,
rather than indentation. Hence, in flow styles, spaces preceding
or following the text in a line are a presentation detail and
must not be considered a part of the node’s content
information. Once all such spaces have been discarded,
folding proceeds as described above. In contrast with the block folded
style, all line
breaks are folded, without exception, and a line
consisting only of spaces is considered to be an empty line, regardless of the number
of spaces. The combined effect of these processing rules is that
each “paragraph” is interpreted as a line, empty lines are used to present a line feed, and text can be
freely “more
indented” without affecting the node’s content
information.

## Chapter 7. YAML Character Stream

A YAML character stream may contain several YAML documents, denoted by
document boundary
markers. Each document presents a single independent root node and may be preceded by a series
of directives.

## 7.1. Directives

*Directives*
are instructions to the YAML processor. Like comments, directives
are presentation
details and are not reflected in the serialization tree (and hence the
representation graph).
This specification defines two directives, “**`YAML`**” and “**`TAG`**”, and *reserves* all other directives
for future use. There is no way to define private directives. This is
intentional.

[85]

l-directive

::=

l-yaml-directive
| #l-tag-directive
| #l-reserved-directive

Each directive is specified on a separate non-indented line starting with the
*“**`%`**”
indicator*, followed by the directive name and a
space-separated list of parameters. The semantics of these tokens
depend on the specific directive. A YAML processor should ignore unknown
directives with an appropriate warning.

### 7.1.1. “**`YAML`**” Directive

The *“**`YAML`**”
directive* specifies the version of YAML the document adheres
to. This specification defines version “**`1.1`**”. A
version 1.1 YAML processor
should accept documents with an explicit
“**`%YAML 1.1`**” directive, as well as documents lacking a
“**`YAML`**” directive. Documents with a “**`YAML`**”
directive specifying a higher minor version (e.g.
“**`%YAML 1.2`**”) should be processed with an
appropriate warning. Documents with a “**`YAML`**”
directive specifying a higher major version (e.g.
“**`%YAML 2.0`**”) should be rejected with an
appropriate error message.

```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "foo"
```
``` example
Legend:

It is an error to specify more than one “**`YAML`**”
directive for the same document, even if both occurrences give the
same version number.

``` example
%YAML 1.1
%YAML 1.1

```

``` example
ERROR:
The YAML directive must only be
given at most once per document.
```

### 7.1.2. “**`TAG`**” Directive

The *“**`TAG`**”
directive* establishes a shorthand notation for specifying node tags. Each
“**`TAG`**” directive associates a handle with a prefix, allowing for compact and readable
tag notation.

```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "foo"
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-tag-directive
  c-tag-handle ns-tag-prefix
```

It is an error to specify more than one “**`TAG`**”
directive for the same handle in the same document, even if both
occurrences give the same prefix.

**Example 7.5. Invalid Repeated TAG directive**

``` example
%TAG ! !foo
%TAG ! !foo
bar
```

``` example
ERROR:
The TAG directive must only
be given at most once per
handle in the same document.
```

#### 7.1.2.1. Tag Prefixes

There are two *tag prefix*
variants:

[92]

ns-tag-prefix

::=

ns-local-tag-prefix
| #ns-global-tag-prefix

Local Tags
If the prefix begins with a “**`!`**” character, shorthands using the
handle are expanded
to a local tag
beginning with “**`!`**”. Note that such a tag is
intentionally not a valid URI, since its semantics are
specific to the application. In particular,
two documents in the same stream may
assign different semantics to the same local tag.

[93]

ns-local-tag-prefix

::=

c-tag
ns-uri-char*

Global Tags
If the prefix begins with a character other than “**`!`**”, it must
to be a valid URI prefix, and should contain at least the
scheme and the authority. Shorthands using the associated handle are expanded to
globally unique URI tags, and their semantics is consistent
across applications.
In particular, two documents in different streams must
assign the same semantics to the same global tag.

[94]

ns-global-tag-prefix

::=

ns-tag-char
ns-uri-char*

**Example 7.6. Tag Prefixes**

``` example
%TAG !      !foo
%TAG !yaml! tag:yaml.org,2002:
---
- !bar "baz"
- !yaml!str "string"
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-local-tag-prefix ns-global-tag-prefix
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !<!foobar> "baz",
  !<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> "string"
]
```

#### 7.1.2.2. Tag Handles

The *tag handle* exactly
matches the prefix of the affected shorthand. There are three tag handle
variants:

[95]

c-tag-handle

::=

  #c-primary-tag-handle

| #c-secondary-tag-handle

| #c-named-tag-handle

Primary Handle
The *primary tag
handle* is a single “**`!`**” character. This
allows using the most compact possible notation for a single
“primary” name space. By default, the prefix
associated with this handle is “**`!`**”. Thus, by default, shorthands using this
handle are interpreted as local
tags. It is possible to override this behavior by
providing an explicit “**`TAG`**” directive
associating a different prefix for this handle. This provides
smooth migration from using local tags to using global tags by a simple addition of a single
“**`TAG`**” directive.

[96]

c-primary-tag-handle

::=

c-tag

**Example 7.7. Migrating from Local to Global Tags**

``` example
# Private application:
!foo "bar"
```
``` example
# Migrated to global:
%TAG ! tag:ben-kiki.org,2000:app/
---
!foo "bar"
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!<!foo> "bar"
```
``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!<tag:ben-kiki.org,2000:app/foo> "bar"
```

Secondary Handle
The *secondary tag
handle* is written as “**`!!`**”. This allows using a
compact notation for a single “secondary” name
space. By default, the prefix associated with this handle is
“**`tag:yaml.org,2002:`**” used by the [/type/index.html](YAML tag
repository) providing recommended tags
for increasing the portability of YAML documents
between different applications. It is possible
to override this behavior by providing an explicit
“**`TAG`**” directive associating a different prefix
for this handle.

[97]

ns-secondary-tag-handle

::=

c-tag
c-tag

Named Handles
A *named tag
handle* surrounds the non-empty name with *“**`!`**”*
characters. A handle name must not be used in a shorthand unless an
explicit “**`TAG`**” directive has associated some
prefix with it. The name of the handle is a presentation detail
and is not part of the node’s content
information. In particular, the YAML processor need not preserve the
handle name once parsing
is completed.

[98]

c-named-tag-handle

::=

c-tag
ns-word-char+
c-tag

**Example 7.8. Tag Handles**

``` example
# Explicitly specify default settings:
%TAG !     !
%TAG !!    tag:yaml.org,2002:
# Named handles have no default:
%TAG !o! tag:ben-kiki.org,2000:
---
- !foo "bar"
- !!str "string"
- !o!type "baz"
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !<!foo> "bar",
  !<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> "string"
  !<tag:ben-kiki.org,2000:type> "baz"
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-primary-tag-handle
  c-secondary-tag-handle
  c-named-tag-handle
```

## 7.2. Document Boundary Markers

YAML streams
use *document boundary
markers* to allow more than one document to be contained in the same
stream. Such
markers are a presentation
detail and are used exclusively to convey structure. A line
beginning with “**`---`**” may be used to explicitly denote
the beginning of a new YAML document.

[99]

c-document-start

::=

“-” “-” “-”

When YAML is used as the format of a communication channel, it is
useful to be able to indicate the end of a document without
closing the stream, independent of starting the next
document.
Lacking such a marker, the YAML processor reading the stream would be forced
to wait for the header of the next document (that may be long time in
coming) in order to detect the end of the previous one. To support
this scenario, a YAML document may be terminated by an
explicit end line denoted by “**`...`**”, followed by
optional comments. To ease the task of
concatenating YAML streams, the end marker may be repeated.

[100]

c-document-end

::=

“.” “.” “.”

[101]

l-document-suffix

::=

( #c-document-end
s-l-comments )+

**Example 7.9. Document Boundary Markers**

``` example
---↓
foo
...
# Repeated end marker.
...↓
---↓
bar
# No end marker.
---↓
baz
...↓
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "foo"
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "bar"
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "baz"
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-document-start l-document-suffix
```

## 7.3. Documents

A YAML *document* is a single native data structure
presented as a single root node. Presentation details such as directives, comments, indentation and styles are not
considered part of the
content
information of the document.

Explicit Documents
An *explicit
document* begins with a document start marker followed by the
presentation of the
root node. The node may begin in the
same line as the document start marker. If the explicit
document’s node is completely empty, it is assumed to be an
empty plain
scalar with no specified properties. Optional document end
marker(s) may follow the document.

[102]

l-explicit-document

::=

c-document-start

( #s-l+block-node(n,c))
| #s-l-empty-block )

l-document-suffix?

Implicit Documents
An *implicit
document* does not begin with a document start
marker. In this case, the root node must not be presented as a completely empty node.
Again, optional document end marker(s) may follow the document.

[103]

l-implicit-document

::=

s-ignored-space*
ns-l+block-node(n,c))

l-document-suffix?

In general, the document’s node is indented as if it has a parent indented at -1 spaces. Since a
node must be more
indented that its parent
node, this allows
the document’s node to be indented at zero or more spaces. Note that flow scalar
continuation lines must be indented by at least one space, even if their first
line is not indented.

**Example 7.10. Documents**

``` example
"Root flow
 scalar"
--- !!str >
 Root block
 scalar
---
# Root collection:
foo : bar
... # Is optional.
---
# Explicit document may be empty.
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-implicit-document l-explicit-document
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "Root flow scalar"
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "Root block scalar"
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "foo"
  : !!str "bar"
}
---
!!str ""
```

## 7.4. Complete Stream

A sequence of bytes is a YAML character *stream* if, taken as a whole, it complies
with the **`l-yaml-stream`**
production. The stream begins with a prefix containing an optional
byte order mark denoting
its character
encoding, followed by optional comments. Note that the stream may
contain no documents, even if it contains a
non-empty prefix. In particular, a stream containing no characters
is valid and contains no documents.

[104]

l-yaml-stream

::=

c-byte-order-mark?
l-comment*

( #l-first-document
l-next-document* )?

**Example 7.11. Empty Stream**

``` example
⇔# A stream may contain
# no documents.
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-yaml-stream
```

``` example
# This stream contains no
# documents, only comments.
```

The first document may be implicit (omit the document start marker).
In such a case it must not specify any directives and will be parsed using the default settings. If the
document is
explicit (begins with
an document start
marker), it may specify directives to control its parsing.

[105]

l-first-document

::=

( #l-implicit-document

| ( #l-directive*
l-explicit-document ) )

**Example 7.12. First Document**

``` example
# Implicit document. Root
# collection (mapping) node.
foo : bar
```
``` example
# Explicit document. Root
# scalar (literal) node.
--- |
 Text content
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-first-document
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "foo"
  : !!str "bar"
}
```
``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "Text content\n"
```

To ease the task of concatenating character streams, following
documents
may begin with a byte order
mark and comments, though the same character encoding must be
used through the stream. Each following document must be explicit (begin with a document start marker).
If the document specifies no directives, it is
parsed using the same settings as
the previous document. If the document does specify
any directives, all directives of
previous documents, if any, are ignored.

[106]

l-next-document

::=

c-byte-order-mark?
l-comment*

l-directive*
l-explicit-document

**Example 7.13. Next Documents**

``` example
! "First document"
---
!foo "No directives"
%TAG ! !foo
---
!bar "With directives"
%YAML 1.1
---
!baz "Reset settings"
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "First document"
---
!<!foo> "No directives"
---
!<!foobar> "With directives"
---
!<!baz> "Reset settings"
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-next-document
```

## Chapter 8. Nodes

Each *presentation
node* may have two optional *properties*, anchor and tag, in addition to its content. Node properties
may be specified in any order before the node’s content, and either or both may
be omitted from the character stream.

[107]

c-ns-properties(n,c)

::=

  ( #c-ns-tag-property

    (
s-separate(n,c))
c-ns-anchor-property )? )

| ( #c-ns-anchor-property

    (
s-separate(n,c))
c-ns-tag-property )? )

**Example 8.1. Node Properties**

``` example
!!str
 &a1↓
  "foo" : !!str bar
&a2 baz : *a1
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-ns-anchor-property c-ns-tag-property
  c-ns-properties(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? &A1 !!str "foo"
  : !!str "bar",
  ? !!str &A2 "baz"
  : *a1
}
```

## 8.1. Node Anchors

The *anchor
property* marks a node for future reference. An anchor is
denoted by the *“**`&`**”
indicator*. An alias node can then be used to indicate
additional inclusions of the anchored node by specifying its anchor.
An anchored node need not be referenced by any alias node; in
particular, it is valid for all nodes to be anchored.

[108]

c-ns-anchor-property

::=

c-anchor
ns-anchor-name

Note that as a serialization
detail, the anchor name is preserved in the serialization tree. However, it is
not reflected in the representation graph and must not
be used to convey content information. In particular, the YAML
processor need not preserve
the anchor name once the representation is composed.

[109]

ns-anchor-name

::=

ns-char+

**Example 8.2. Node Anchors**

``` example
First occurrence: &anchor Value
Second occurrence: *anchor
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-ns-anchor-property
  ns-anchor-name
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "First occurrence"
  : &A !!str "Value",
  ? !!str "Second occurrence"
  : *A
}
```

## 8.2. Node Tags

The *tag property*
identifies the type of the native data structure presented by the node. A tag is denoted by the *“**`!`**” indicator*.
In
contrast with anchors, tags are an inherent part of
the representation graph.

[110]

c-ns-tag-property

::=

  #c-verbatim-tag
| #c-ns-shorthand-tag

| #c-ns-non-specific-tag

Verbatim Tags
A tag may be written *verbatim* by surrounding it with the *“**`<`**”
and “**`>`**”* characters. In this case, the
YAML processor must
deliver the verbatim tag as-is to the application. In particular,
verbatim tags are not subject to tag resolution. A verbatim tag must either
begin with a “**`!`**” (a local tag) or be a valid URI (a global tag).

[111]

c-verbatim-tag

::=

c-tag
“&lt;”
ns-uri-char+
“&gt;”

**Example 8.3. Verbatim Tags**

``` example
!<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> foo :
  !<!bar> baz
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-verbatim-tag
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> "foo"
  : !<!bar> "baz"
}
```

**Example 8.4. Invalid Verbatim Tags**

``` example
- !<!> foo
- !<$:?> bar
```

``` example
ERROR:
- Verbatim tags aren't resolved,
  so ! is invalid.
- The $:? tag is neither a global
  URI tag nor a local tag starting
  with “!”.
```

Tag Shorthands
A *tag shorthand*
consists of a valid tag
handle followed by a non-empty suffix. The tag handle must be associated with
a prefix, either by
default or by using a “**`TAG`**” directive. The
resulting parsed tag is the
concatenation of the prefix and the suffix, and must either begin
with “**`!`**”
(a local tag) or be a
valid URI (a global tag).
When the primary tag
handle is used, the suffix must not contain any
“**`!`**”
character, as this would cause the tag shorthand to be
interpreted as having a named
tag handle. If the “**`!`**” character exists in the
suffix of a tag using the primary tag handle, it must be escaped as “**`%21`**”, and
the parser should expand this particular escape sequence before
passing the tag to the application. This behavior is consistent
with the URI character quoting rules (specifically, section 1.3
of http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt), and
ensures the choice of tag
handle remains a presentation detail and is not
reflected in the serialization
tree (and hence the representation graph). In
particular, the tag
handle may be discarded once parsing is completed.

[112]

c-ns-shorthand-tag

::=

  ( #c-primary-tag-handle
ns-tag-char+ )

| ( #c-secondary-tag-handle
ns-uri-char+ )

| ( #c-named-tag-handle
ns-uri-char+ )

**Example 8.5. Tag Shorthands**

``` example
%TAG !o! tag:ben-kiki.org,2000:
---
- !local foo
- !!str bar
- !o!type baz
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-ns-shorthand-tag
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !<!local> "foo",
  !<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> "bar",
  !<tag:ben-kiki.org,2000:type> "baz",
]
```

**Example 8.6. Invalid Shorthand Tags**

``` example
%TAG !o! tag:ben-kiki.org,2000:
---
- !$a!b foo
- !o! bar
- !h!type baz
```

``` example
ERROR:
- The !$a! looks like a handle.
- The !o! handle has no suffix.
- The !h! handle wasn't declared.
```

Non-Specific Tags
If a node
has no tag property, it is assigned a non-specific tag: “**`?`**” for
plain
scalars and “**`!`**” for all other nodes. Non-specific tags must be
resolved to a
specific tag for a
complete
representation graph to be composed. It is also possible for the
tag property to explicitly specify the node has the “**`!`**” non-specific tag.
This is only useful for plain scalars, causing them to be
resolved as if they
were non-plain (hence, by the common tag resolution convention, as
“**`tag:yaml.org,2002:str`**”). There is no way to
explicitly set the tag to the “**`?`**” non-specific tag. This is
intentional.

[113]

c-ns-non-specific-tag

::=

c-tag

**Example 8.7. Non-Specific Tags**

``` example
# Assuming conventional resolution:
- "12"
- 12
- ! 12
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-ns-non-specific-tag
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> "12",
  !<tag:yaml.org,2002:int> "12",
  !<tag:yaml.org,2002:str> "12",
]
```

## 8.3. Node Content

*Node content*
may be presented in either a
flow style
or a block
style. Block content always extends to the end
of a line and uses indentation to denote structure, while flow content starts
and ends at some non-space character within a line and uses indicators to denote structure. Each
collection kind can be presented in
a single flow collection style or a single
block
collection style. However, each collection kind also provides compact in-line forms
for common cases. Scalar
content may be presented in the plain style or one of the two
quoted
styles (the single-quoted style and the double-quoted
style). Regardless of style, scalar content must always be indented by at least one space.
In contrast, collection content need not be indented (note that the
indentation of the
first flow
scalar line is determined by the block collection it is
nested in, if any).

## 8.4. Alias Nodes

Subsequent occurrences of a previously serialized node are presented as *alias nodes*, denoted by the *“**`*`**”
indicator*. The first
occurrence of the node must be marked by an anchor to allow
subsequent occurrences to be presented as alias nodes. An alias node
refers to the most recent preceding node having the same anchor. It is an error
to have an alias node use an anchor that does not previously occur in
the document. It is not an error to specify
an anchor that
is not used by any alias node. Note that an alias node must not
specify any properties or
content, as
these were already specified at the first occurrence of the node.

[120]

c-ns-alias-node

::=

c-alias
ns-anchor-name

**Example 8.11. Alias Nodes**

``` example
First occurrence: &anchor Value
Second occurrence: *anchor
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-ns-alias-node
  ns-anchor-name
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "First occurrence"
  : &A !!str "Value",
  ? !!str "Second occurrence"
  : *A
}
```

## 8.5. Complete Nodes

### 8.5.1. Flow Nodes

A complete *flow
node* is either an alias node presenting a second occurrence of a
previous node,
or consists of the node
properties followed by the node’s content. A node with empty
content is
considered to be an empty plain scalar.

[121]

ns-flow-node(n,c)

::=

  #c-ns-alias-node
| #ns-flow-content(n,c))

| ( #c-ns-properties(n,c))

    (
/* empty plain scalar content */

    | (
s-separate(n,c))
ns-flow-content(n,c)) ) ) )

**Example 8.12. Flow Nodes in Flow Context**

``` example
[
  Without properties,
  &anchor "Anchored",
  !!str 'Tagged',
  *anchor, # Alias node
  !!str,   # Empty plain scalar
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-flow-node(n,c) ns-flow-content(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "Without properties",
  &A !!str "Anchored",
  !!str "Tagged",
  *A,
  !!str "",
]
```

Since both the node’s
properties and node content are optional, this allows
for a *completely empty
node*. Completely empty nodes are only valid when
following some explicit indicator for their existence.

[122]

e-empty-flow

::=

/* empty plain scalar node */

In the examples, completely empty nodes are displayed as the glyph
“**`°`**”. Note that this glyph corresponds to a
position in the characters stream rather than to an actual
character.

**Example 8.13. Completely Empty Flow Nodes**

``` example
{
  ? foo :°,
  ?° : bar,
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  e-empty-flow
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "foo"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "",
  : !!str "bar",
}
```

### 8.5.2. Block Nodes

A complete *block
node* consists of the node’s properties followed by the node’s content.
In addition, a block node may consist of a (possibly completely empty)
flow
node followed by a line break (with optional comments).

[123]

ns-l+flow-in-block(n,c)

::=

ns-flow-node(n,c))
s-l-comments

[124]

ns-l+block-in-block(n,c)

::=

( #c-ns-properties(n,c))
s-separate(n,c)) )?

c-l+block-content(n,c))

[125]

ns-l+block-node(n,c)

::=

  #ns-l+block-in-block(n,c))

| #ns-l+flow-in-block(n,c))

[126]

s-l+block-node(n,c)

::=

s-separate(n,c))
ns-l+block-node(n,c))

**Example 8.14. Block Nodes**

``` example
-·"flow in block"↓
-·>
 Block scalar↓
-·!!map # Block collection
  foo : bar↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-l+flow-in-block(n,c)
  ns-l+block-in-block(n,c)
  s-l+block-node(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "flow in block",
  !!str "Block scalar\n",
  !!map {
    ? !!str "foo"
    : !!str "bar"
  }
]
```

A block node always spans to the end of the line, even when
completely
empty. Completely empty block nodes may only appear when
there is some explicit indicator for their existence.

[127]

s-l-empty-block

::=

e-empty-flow
s-l-comments

**Example 8.15. Completely Empty Block Nodes**

``` example
seq:
-° # Empty plain scalar↓
- ? foo
  :°↓
  ?°↓
  : bar,
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-l-empty-block
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "",
  !!map {
    ? !!str "foo"
    : !!str "",
    ? !!str "",
    : !!str "bar",
  }
]
```

## Chapter 9. Scalar Styles

YAML provides a rich set of *scalar styles* to choose from, depending upon
the readability requirements: three scalar flow styles (the plain style and the
two *quoted
styles*: single-quoted and double-quoted), and two scalar block
styles (the literal style and the folded style).
Comments may
precede or follow scalar content, but must not appear inside it. Scalar
node style is a presentation
detail and must not be used to convey content
information, with the exception that untagged plain scalars are resolved in a distinct way.

## 9.1. Flow Scalar Styles

All *flow scalar
styles* may span multiple lines, except when used in simple keys. Flow scalars are subject to
(flow) line folding. This
allows flow scalar content to be broken anywhere a single space
character (**`#x20`**) separates non-space characters,
at the cost of requiring an empty
line to present each
line feed character.

### 9.1.1. Double Quoted

The *double-quoted style* is specified by
surrounding *“**`"`**” indicators*. This is the only
scalar style
capable of expressing arbitrary strings, by using “**`\`**” escape sequences. Therefore, the
“**`\`**” and “**`"`**”
characters must also be escaped when present in
double-quoted content. Note it is an error for double-quoted
content to contain invalid escape sequences.

[128]

nb-double-char

::=

( #nb-char
- #c-escape
- #c-double-quote )
| #ns-esc-char

[129]

ns-double-char

::=

nb-double-char
- #s-white

Double-quoted scalars are restricted to a single line when
contained inside a simple
key.

[130]

c-double-quoted(n,c)

::=

c-double-quote
nb-double-text(n,c))
c-double-quote

[131]

nb-double-text(n,c)

::=

c = flow-out ⇒
nb-double-any(n))

c = flow-in  ⇒
nb-double-any(n))

c = flow-key ⇒
nb-double-single

[132]

nb-double-any(n)

::=

nb-double-single
| #nb-double-multi(n))

**Example 9.1. Double Quoted Scalars**

``` example
"simple key" : {
  "also simple" : value,
  ? "not a
  simple key" : "any
  value"
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  nb-double-single nb-double-multi(n)
  c-double-quoted(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "simple key"
  : !!map {
    ? !!str "also simple"
    : !!str "value",
    ? !!str "not a simple key"
    : !!str "any value"
  }
}
```

A single line double-quoted scalar is a sequence of (possibly
escaped) non-break Unicode characters. All characters are
considered content, including any leading or
trailing white space
characters.

[133]

nb-double-single

::=

nb-double-char*

In a multi-line double-quoted scalar, line breaks are subject to flow line folding, and any trailing white space is
excluded from the
content.
However, an *escaped
line break* (using a “**`\`**”) is excluded from
the content, while white space preceding it is preserved. This allows
double-quoted content to be broken at arbitrary positions.

[134]

s-l-double-folded(n)

::=

s-ignored-white*
b-l-folded-any(n,s))

[135]

s-l-double-escaped(n)

::=

s-white*
c-escape
b-ignored-any

l-empty(n,s))*

[136]

s-l-double-break(n)

::=

s-l-double-folded(n))
| #s-l-double-escaped(n))

**Example 9.2. Double Quoted Line Breaks**

``` example
"as space→↓
 trimmed·↓
↓
 specific⇓
↓
 escaped→\¶
·↓
 none"
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "as space \
  trimmed\n\
  specific\L\n\
  escaped\t\
  none"
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-l-double-folded(n) s-l-double-escaped(n)
  s-ignored-white      s-white (Content)
```

A multi-line double-quoted scalar consists of a (possibly empty)
first line, any number of inner lines, and a final (possibly empty)
last line.

[137]

nb-double-multi(n)

::=

nb-l-double-first(n))

l-double-inner(n))*

s-nb-double-last(n))

Leading white space in the
first line is considered content only if followed by a
non-space character or an escaped (ignored) line break.

[138]

nb-l-double-first(n)

::=

( #nb-double-char*
ns-double-char )?

s-l-double-break(n))

**Example 9.3. First Double Quoted Line**

``` example
- "↓
  last"
- "·→↓
  last"
- "·→first↓
  last"
```
``` example
Legend:
  nb-l-double-first(n) s-ignored-white
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str " last",
  !!str " last",
  !!str " \tfirst last",
]
```

All leading and trailing white
space of an inner lines are excluded from the content. Note that
while prefix white
space may contain tab
characters, line indentation is restricted to space characters
only. It is possible to force considering leading white space as content by escaping the
first character (“**`\·`**”, “**`\→`**”
or “**`\t`**”).

[139]

l-double-inner(n)

::=

s-ignored-prefix(n,s))
ns-double-char

( #nb-double-char*
ns-double-char )?

s-l-double-break(n))

**Example 9.4. Inner Double Quoted Lines**

``` example
"first
·→inner 1→↓
·\·inner 2·\↓
 last"
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-double-inner(n)
  s-ignored-prefix(n,s) s-l-double-break(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "first·\
  inner 1··\
  inner 2·\
  last"
```

The leading prefix
white space of the last
line is stripped in the same way as for inner lines. Trailing
white space is considered
content
only if preceded by a non-space character.

[140]

s-nb-double-last(n)

::=

s-ignored-prefix(n,s))

( #ns-double-char
nb-double-char* )?

**Example 9.5. Last Double Quoted Line**

``` example
- "first
··→"
- "first

··→last"
- "first
 inner
·\·→last"
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "first ",
  !!str "first\nlast",
  !!str "first inner··\tlast",
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-nb-double-last(n)
  s-ignored-prefix(n,s)
```

### 9.1.2. Single Quoted

The *single-quoted style* is specified by
surrounding *“**`'`**” indicators*. Therefore, within a
single-quoted scalar such characters need to be repeated. This is
the only form of *escaping* performed in single-quoted scalars. In
particular, the “**`\`**” and “**`"`**” characters may be
freely used. This restricts single-quoted scalars to printable characters.

[141]

c-quoted-quote

::=

c-single-quote
c-single-quote

[142]

nb-single-char

::=

( #nb-char
- #c-single-quote )
| #c-quoted-quote

[143]

ns-single-char

::=

nb-single-char
- #s-white

**Example 9.6. Single Quoted Quotes**

``` example
'here''s to "quotes"'
```
``` example
Legend:
  single-quoted-quote
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "here's to \"quotes\""
```

Single-quoted scalars are restricted to a single line when
contained inside a simple
key.

[144]

c-single-quoted(n,c)

::=

c-single-quote
nb-single-text(n,c))
c-single-quote

[145]

nb-single-text(n,c)

::=

c = flow-out ⇒
nb-single-any(n))

c = flow-in  ⇒
nb-single-any(n))

c = flow-key ⇒
nb-single-single)

[146]

nb-single-any(n)

::=

nb-single-single)
| #nb-single-multi(n))

**Example 9.7. Single Quoted Scalars**

``` example
'simple key' : {
  'also simple' : value,
  ? 'not a
  simple key' : 'any
  value'
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  nb-single-single nb-single-multi(n)
  c-single-quoted(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "simple key"
  : !!map {
    ? !!str "also simple"
    : !!str "value",
    ? !!str "not a simple key"
    : !!str "any value"
  }
}
```

A single line single-quoted scalar is a sequence of non-break printable characters. All
characters are considered content, including any leading or
trailing white space
characters.

[147]

nb-single-single(n)

::=

nb-single-char*

In a multi-line single-quoted scalar, line breaks are subject to (flow) line folding, and any trailing
white space is excluded
from the content.

[148]

s-l-single-break(n)

::=

s-ignored-white*
b-l-folded-any(n,s))

**Example 9.8. Single Quoted Line Breaks**

``` example
'as space→↓
 trimmed·↓
↓
 specific⇓
↓
 none'
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "as space \
  trimmed\n\
  specific\L\n\
  none"
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-l-single-break(n)
  s-ignored-white s-white (Content)
```

A multi-line single-quoted scalar consists of a (possibly empty)
first line, any number of inner lines, and a final (possibly empty)
last line.

[149]

nb-single-multi(n)

::=

nb-l-single-first(n))

l-single-inner(n))*

s-nb-single-last(n))

Leading white space in the
first line is considered content only if followed by a
non-space character.

[150]

nb-l-single-first(n)

::=

( #nb-single-char*
ns-single-char )?

s-l-single-break(n))

**Example 9.9. First Single Quoted Line**

``` example
- '↓
  last'
- '·→↓
  last'
- '·→first↓
  last'
```
``` example
Legend:
  nb-l-single-first(n) s-ignored-white
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str " last",
  !!str " last",
  !!str " \tfirst last",
]
```

All leading and trailing white
space of inner lines is excluded from the content. Note that
while prefix white
space may contain tab
characters, line indentation is restricted to space characters
only. Unlike double-quoted scalars, it is
impossible to force the inclusion of the leading or trailing spaces
in the content. Therefore, single-quoted
scalars lines can only be broken where a single space character
separates two non-space characters.

[151]

l-single-inner(n)

::=

s-ignored-prefix(n,s))
ns-single-char

( #nb-single-char*
ns-single-char )?

s-l-single-break(n))

**Example 9.10. Inner Single Quoted Lines**

``` example
'first
·→inner→↓
 last'
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-single-inner(n)
  s-ignored-prefix(n,s) s-l-single-break(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "first \
  inner \
  last"
```

The leading prefix
white space of the last
line is stripped in the same way as for inner lines. Trailing
white space is considered
content
only if preceded by a non-space character.

[152]

s-nb-single-last(n)

::=

s-ignored-prefix(n,s))

( #ns-single-char
nb-single-char* )?

**Example 9.11. Last Single Quoted Lines**

``` example
- 'first
··→'
- 'first

··→last'
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-nb-double-last(n) s-ignored-prefix(n,s)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "first ",
  !!str "first\nlast",
]
```

### 9.1.3. Plain

The *plain
style* uses no identifying indicators, and is therefore the most
limited and most context
sensitive scalar
style. Plain scalars can never contain any tab characters. They also must not contain
the “**`: `**” and “**` #`**” character sequences as
these combinations cause ambiguity with key: value pairs and comments. Inside
flow
collections, plain scalars are further restricted to
avoid containing the “**`[`**”, [“**`]`**”](#%5D%20end%20flow%20sequence/), “**`{`**”, “**`}`**” and
“**`,`**”
characters as these would cause ambiguity with the flow
collection structure (hence the need for the *flow-in context* and the
*flow-out context*).

[153]

nb-plain-char(c)

::=

c = flow-out ⇒ #nb-plain-char-out

c = flow-in  ⇒ #nb-plain-char-in

c = flow-key ⇒ #nb-plain-char-in

[154]

nb-plain-char-out

::=

  ( #nb-char
- #c-mapping-value
- #c-comment
- #x9 /*TAB*/ )

| ( #ns-plain-char(c))
c-comment )

| ( #c-mapping-value
ns-plain-char(c)) )

[155]

nb-plain-char-in

::=

nb-plain-char-out
- #c-collect-entry
- #c-sequence-start
- #c-sequence-end
- #c-mapping-start
- #c-mapping-end

[156]

ns-plain-char(c)

::=

nb-plain-char(c)) - #x20 /*SP*/

The first plain character is further restricted to avoid most
indicators as these would
cause ambiguity with various YAML structures. However, the first
character may be “**`-`**”, “**`?`**” or “**`:`**” provided it is followed by a
non-space character.

[157]

ns-plain-first-char(c)

::=

  ( #ns-plain-char(c))
- #c-indicator )

| ( ( #c-sequence-entry
| #c-mapping-key
| #c-mapping-value )
ns-plain-char(c)) )

**Example 9.12. Plain Characters**

``` example
# Outside flow collection:
- ::std::vector
- Up, up and away!
- -123
# Inside flow collection:
- [ ::std::vector,
  "Up, up and away!",
  -123 ]
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-plain-first-char(c)
  ns-plain-char(c) Not ns-plain-char(c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "::std::vector",
  !!str "Up, up, and away!",
  !!int "-123",
  !!seq [
    !!str "::std::vector",
    !!str "Up, up, and away!",
    !!int "-123",
  ]
]
```

Plain scalars are restricted to a single line when contained inside
a simple key.

[158]

ns-plain(n,c)

::=

c = flow-out ⇒ #ns-plain-multi(n,c))?

c = flow-in  ⇒ #ns-plain-multi(n,c))?

c = flow-key ⇒ #ns-plain-single(c))

**Example 9.13. Plain Scalars**

``` example
simple key : {
  also simple : value,
  ? not a
  simple key : any
  value
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-plain-single(c) ns-plain-multi(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "simple key"
  : !!map {
    ? !!str "also simple"
    : !!str "value",
    ? !!str "not a simple key"
    : !!str "any value"
  }
}
```

The first line of any flow scalar is indented according to the
collection it is contained in.
Therefore, there are two cases where a plain scalar begins on the
first column of a line, without any preceding indentation spaces: a plain
scalar used as a simple key
of a non-indented block mapping, and any plain scalar
nested in a non-indented flow collection. In these cases, the
first line of the plain scalar must not conflict with a document boundary
marker.

[159]

l-forbidden-content

::=

/* start of line */

( #c-document-start
| #c-document-end )

/* space or end of line */

**Example 9.14. Forbidden Non-Indented Plain Scalar Content**

``` example
---
---·||| : foo
...·>>>: bar
---
[
---↓
,
...·,
{
---·:
...·# Nested
}
]
...
```

``` example
ERROR:
 The --- and ... document
 start and end markers must
 not be specified as the
 first content line of a
 non-indented plain scalar.
```

YAML provides several easy ways to present such content without conflicting with the
document boundary
markers. For example:

**Example 9.15. Document Marker Scalar Content**

``` example
---
"---" : foo
...: bar
---
[
---,
...,
{
? ---
: ...
}
]
...
```
``` example
Legend:
  Content --- and ...
  Document marker --- and ...
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "---"
  : !!str "foo",
  ? !!str "...",
  : !!str "bar"
}
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "---",
  !!str "...",
  !!map {
    ? !!str "---"
    : !!str "..."
  }
]
```

Thus, a single line plain scalar is a sequence of valid plain
non-break
printable
characters, beginning and ending with non-space character and not
conflicting with a document boundary markers. All characters are
considered content, including any inner space
characters.

[160]

ns-plain-single(c)

::=

  ( #ns-plain-first-char(c))

    ( #nb-plain-char(c))*
ns-plain-char(c)) )? )

- #l-forbidden-content

In a multi-line plain scalar, line breaks are subject to (flow) line folding. Any prefix and trailing spaces
are excluded from the content. Like single-quoted
scalars, in plain scalars it is impossible to force the
inclusion of the leading or trailing spaces in the content. Therefore,
plain scalars lines can only be broken where a single space
character separates two non-space characters.

[161]

s-l-plain-break(n)

::=

s-ignored-white*
b-l-folded-any(n,s))

**Example 9.16. Plain Line Breaks**

``` example
as space→↓
 trimmed·↓
↓
 specific⇓
↓
 none
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "as space \
  trimmed\n\
  specific\L\n\
  none"
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-l-plain-break(n)
  s-ignored-white
```

A multi-line plain scalar contains additional continuation lines
following the first line.

[162]

ns-plain-multi(n,c)

::=

ns-plain-single(c))
s-ns-plain-more(n,c))*

Each continuation line must contain at least one non-space
character. Note that it may be preceded by any number of empty lines.

[163]

s-ns-plain-more(n,c)

::=

s-l-plain-break(n))

s-ignored-prefix(n,s))
ns-plain-char(c))

( #nb-plain-char(c))*
ns-plain-char(c)) )?

**Example 9.17. Plain Scalars**

``` example

···↓
··more line
```
``` example

```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "first line\n\
      more line"
```

## 9.2. Block Scalar Header

Block
scalars are specified by several indicators given in a *header* preceding the content itself. The
header is followed by an ignored line break (with an optional comment).

[164]

c-b-block-header(s,m,t)

::=

c-style-indicator(s))

( ( #c-indentation-indicator(m))

    #c-chomping-indicator(t)) )

| ( #c-chomping-indicator(t))

    #c-indentation-indicator(m)) ) )

s-b-comment

**Example 9.18. Block Scalar Header**

``` example
- | # Just the style↓
 literal
- >1 # Indentation indicator↓
 ·folded
- |+ # Chomping indicator↓
 keep

- >-1 # Both indicators↓
 ·strip
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "literal\n",
  !!str "·folded\n",
  !!str "keep\n\n",
  !!str "·strip",
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-b-block-header(s,m,t)
```

### 9.2.1. Block Style Indicator

The first character of the block scalar header is either *“**`|`**”* for a literal scalar
or *“**`>`**”* for a folded scalar.

[165]

c-style-indicator(s)

::=

s = literal ⇒ #c-literal

s = folded  ⇒ #c-folded

**Example 9.19. Block Style Indicator**

``` example
- |
 literal
- >
 folded
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-style-indicator(s)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "literal\n",
  !!str "folded\n",
]
```

### 9.2.2. Block Indentation Indicator

Typically, the indentation level of a block scalar is detected
from its first non-empty
line. This detection fails when this line contains leading space
characters (note it may safely start with a tab or a “**`#`**” character). When detection
fails, YAML requires that the indentation level for the content be given
using an explicit *indentation indicator*. This level is specified
as the integer number of the additional indentation spaces used for
the content. If the block
scalar begins with leading empty lines followed by a non-empty line, the indentation level is deduced
from the non-empty line. In
this case, it is an error for any such leading empty line to contain more spaces
than the indentation
level deduced from the non-empty line. It is always valid to specify an
indentation indicator for a block scalar node, though a YAML
processor should only do so
in cases where detection will fail.

[166]

c-indentation-indicator(m)

::=

explicit(m) ⇒ #ns-dec-digit
- “0”

detect(m)   ⇒ /* empty */

**Example 9.20. Block Indentation Indicator**

``` example
- |
·detected
- >
·
··
··# detected
- |1
··explicit
- >
·→
·detected
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "detected\n",
  !!str "\n\n# detected\n",
  !!str "·explicit\n",
  !!str "\t·detected\n",
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-indentation-indicator(m)
  s-indent(n)
```

**Example 9.21. Invalid Block Scalar Indentation Indicators**

``` example
- |
··
·text
- >
··text
·text
- |1
·text
```

``` example
ERROR:
- A leading all-space line must
  not have too many spaces.
- A following text line must
  not be less indented.
- The text is less indented
  than the indicated level.
```

### 9.2.3. Block Chomping Indicator

YAML supports three possible block *chomping* methods:

Strip
*Stripping* is
specified using the *“**`-`**” chomping indicator*. In
this case, the line
break character of the last non-empty line (if any) is excluded
from the scalar’s content. Any trailing
empty lines are
considered to be (empty) comment lines and are also
discarded.

Clip
*Clipping* is the
default behavior used if no explicit chomping indicator is
specified. In this case, The line break character of the last
non-empty line (if any)
is preserved in the scalar’s content. However, any
trailing empty lines
are considered to be (empty) comment lines and are discarded.

Keep
*Keeping* is specified
using the *“**`+`**”
chomping indicator*. In this case, the line break character
of the last non-empty
line (if any) is preserved in the scalar’s
content. In addition, any trailing empty lines are each considered
to present a single
trailing contentline break. Note that these line breaks are not
subject to folding.

The chomping method used is a presentation detail and is not reflected in the
serialization tree (and
hence the representation graph).

[167]

c-chomping-indicator(t)

::=

t = strip ⇒
“-”

t = clip  ⇒
/* empty */

t = keep  ⇒
“+”

Thus, the final line
break of a block scalar may be included or
excluded from the content, depending on the specified
chomping indicator.

[168]

b-chomped-last(t)

::=

t = strip ⇒
b-strip-last

t = clip  ⇒
b-keep-last

t = keep  ⇒
b-keep-last

[169]

b-strip-last

::=

b-ignored-any

[170]

b-keep-last

::=

b-normalized

**Example 9.22. Chomping Final Line Break**

``` example
strip: |-
  text¶
clip: |
  text↓
keep: |+
  text⇓
```
``` example
Legend:
  b-strip-last
  b-keep-last
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "strip"
  : !!str "text",
  ? !!str "clip"
  : !!str "text\n",
  ? !!str "keep"
  : !!str "text\L",
}
```

Similarly, empty lines
immediately following the block scalar may be interpreted either
as presenting trailing
line breaks or as
(empty) comment lines, depending on the
specified chomping indicator.

[171]

l-chomped-empty(n,t)

::=

t = strip ⇒
l-strip-empty(n))

t = clip  ⇒
l-strip-empty(n))

t = keep  ⇒
l-keep-empty(n))

[172]

l-strip-empty(n)

::=

( #s-indent(n))
b-ignored-any )*
l-trail-comments(n))?

[173]

l-keep-empty(n)

::=

l-empty(n,s))*
l-trail-comments(n))?

Explicit comment lines may then follow. To
prevent ambiguity, the first such comment line must be less indented than the block scalar
content. Additional comment lines, if any, are not so
restricted.

[174]

l-trail-comments(n)

::=

s-indent(n))
c-nb-comment-text
b-ignored-any

l-comment*

**Example 9.23. Block Scalar Chomping**

``` example
# Strip
  # Comments:
strip: |-
  # text¶
··⇓
·# Clip
··# comments:
↓
clip: |
  # text↓
·¶
·# Keep
··# comments:
↓
keep: |+
  # text⇓
↓
·# Trail
··# comments.
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  ? !!str "strip"
  : !!str "# text",
  ? !!str "clip"
  : !!str "# text\n",
  ? !!str "keep"
  : !!str "# text\L\n",
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-strip-empty(n)
  l-keep-empty(n)
  l-trail-comments(n)
```

Note that if a block scalar consists of only empty lines, then these lines are
considered trailing lines and hence are affected by chomping.

**Example 9.24. Empty Scalar Chomping**

``` example
strip: >-
↓
clip: >
↓
keep: |+
↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-strip-empty(n)
  l-keep-empty(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  ? !!str "strip"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "clip"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "keep"
  : !!str "\n",
]
```

## 9.3. Block Scalar Styles

YAML provides two *Block scalar styles*, literal and
folded.
The block scalar content is ended by a less-indented line or the end of the
characters stream.

### 9.3.1. Literal

The *literal
style* is the simplest, most restricted and most readable
scalar
style. It is especially suitable for source code or other
text containing significant use of indicators, escape
sequences and line breaks. In particular, literal content
lines may begin with a tab or a
“**`#`**”
character.

[175]

c-l+literal(n)

::=

c-b-block-header(s,m,t))

l-literal-content(n,t))

**Example 9.25. Literal Scalar**

``` example
| # Simple block scalar↓
 literal↓
 →text↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-b-block-header(s,m,t)
  l-literal-content(n,t)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "literal\n\
        \ttext\n"
]
```

Inside literal scalars, each non-empty line may be preceded by any number of
empty lines. No processing
is performed on these lines except for stripping the indentation. In particular,
such lines are never folded. Literal non-empty lines may include only spaces, tabs, and other printable characters.

[176]

l-nb-literal-text(n)

::=

l-empty(n,s))*
s-indent(n))
nb-char+

**Example 9.26. Literal Text**

``` example
|
·
··
··literal↓
·
··text↓
↓
·# Comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "\nliteral\n\ntext\n"
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-nb-literal-text(n)
```

The line break
following a non-empty inner
literal line is normalized. Again, such line breaks are never
folded.

[177]

l-literal-inner(n)

::=

l-nb-literal-text(n))
b-normalized

**Example 9.27. Inner Literal Lines**

``` example
|
·
··
··literal↓
·
··text↓
↓
·# Comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "\nliteral\n\ntext\n"
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-nb-literal-inner(n)
  b-normalized
```

The line break
following the final non-empty literal line is subject to chomping.

[178]

l-literal-last(n,t)

::=

l-nb-literal-text(n))
b-chomped-last(t))

Trailing empty lines
following the last literal non-empty
line, if any, are also subject to chomping.

[179]

l-literal-content(n,t)

::=

( #l-nb-literal-inner(n))*
l-nb-literal-last(n,t)) )?

l-chomped-empty(n,t))?

**Example 9.28. Last Literal Line**

``` example
|
·
··
··literal↓
·
··text↓
↓
·# Comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!str "\nliteral\n\ntext\n"
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-nb-literal-last(n,t)
  b-chomped-last(t)
  l-chomped-empty(n,t)
```

### 9.3.2. Folded

The *folded
style* is similar to the literal style. However, unlike
literal
content, folded content is subject to (block) line folding.

[180]

c-l+folded(n)

::=

c-b-block-header(s,m,t))

l-folded-content(n,t))

**Example 9.29. Folded Scalar**

``` example
> # Simple folded scalar↓
 folded↓
 text↓
 →lines↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-b-block-header(s,m,t)
  l-folded-content(n,t)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "folded text\n\
        \tlines\n"
]
```

Line folding allows long
content
lines to be broken anywhere a single space character separates two
non-space characters.

[181]

s-nb-folded-line(n)

::=

s-indent(n))
ns-char
nb-char*

[182]

l-nb-folded-lines(n)

::=

( #s-nb-folded-text(n))

  #b-l-folded-any(n,s)) )*

s-nb-folded-text(n))

**Example 9.30. Folded Lines**

``` example
>
·folded↓
·line↓
↓
·next
·line↓

   * bullet
   * list

·last↓
·line↓

# Comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "folded line\n\
        next line\n\
        \  * bullet\n\
        \  * list\n\
        last line\n"
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-nb-folded-lines(n)
```

Lines starting with white
space characters (*“more indented” lines*) are not
folded. Note that folded
scalars, like literal scalars, may contain tab characters. However, any such
characters must be properly indented using only space characters.

[183]

b-l-spaced(n)

::=

b-normalized
l-empty(n,s))*

[184]

s-nb-spaced-text(n)

::=

s-indent(n))
s-white
nb-char*

[185]

l-nb-spaced-lines(n)

::=

( #s-nb-spaced-text(n))
b-l-spaced(n)) )*

s-nb-spaced-text(n))

**Example 9.31. Spaced Lines**

``` example
>
 folded
 line

 next
 line

···* bullet↓
···* list↓

 last
 line

# Comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "folded line\n\
        next line\n\
        \  * bullet\n\
        \  * list\n\
        last line\n"
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  l-nb-spaced-lines(n)
```

Folded content may start with either line type. If the content begins with
a “more indented” line (starting with spaces), an
indentation
indicator must be specified in the block header. Note
that leading empty lines
and empty lines separating
lines of a different type are never folded.

[186]

l-nb-start-with-folded(n)

::=

l-empty(n,s))*
l-nb-folded-lines(n))

( #b-normalized
l-nb-start-with-spaced(n)) )?

[187]

l-nb-start-with-spaced(n)

::=

l-empty(n,s))*
l-nb-spaced-lines(n))

( #b-normalized
l-nb-start-with-folded(n)) )?

[188]

l-nb-start-with-any(n)

::=

  #l-nb-start-with-folded(n))

| #l-nb-start-with-spaced(n))

**Example 9.32. Empty Separation Lines**

``` example
>
 folded
 line

 next
 line↓
↓
   * bullet
   * list↓
↓
 last
 line

# Comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "folded line\n\
        next line\n\
        \  * bullet\n\
        \  * list\n\
        last line\n"
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  b-normalized l-empty(n,s)
```

The final line
break, and trailing empty
lines, if any, are subject to chomping and are never folded.

[189]

l-folded-content(n,t)

::=

( #l-nb-start-with-any(n))
b-chomped-last(t)) )?

l-chomped-empty(n,t))

**Example 9.33. Final Empty Lines**

``` example
>
 folded
 line

 next
 line

   * bullet
   * list

 last
 line↓
↓
# Comment
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "folded line\n\
        next line\n\
        \  * bullet\n\
        \  * list\n\
        last line\n"
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  b-chomped-last(t) l-chomped-empty(n,t)
```

## Chapter 10. Collection Styles

*Collection
content* can be presented in a single *flow style* and a single
*block
style* for each of the two collection
kinds (sequence and mapping). In addition, YAML provides several
in-line
compact syntax forms for improved readability of common special cases. In
all cases, the collection style is a presentation detail and must not be used to convey
content
information.

A flow collection may be nested within a block collection (flow-out context), nested within
another flow collection (flow-in
context), or be a part of a simple key (flow-key
context). Flow collection entries are separated by the
*“**`,`**”
indicator*. The final “**`,`**” may be omitted. This
does not cause ambiguity because flow collection entries can never be
completely empty.

[190]

in-flow(c)

::=

c = flow-out ⇒ flow-in

c = flow-in  ⇒ flow-in

c = flow-key ⇒ flow-key

## 10.1. Sequence Styles

*Sequence
content* is an ordered collection of sub-nodes. Comments may be
interleaved between the sub-nodes. Sequences may be presented in a flow style or a block
style. YAML provides compact notations for in-line nesting of
a collection
in a block
sequence and for nesting a single pair mapping in a flow
sequence.

### 10.1.1. Flow Sequences

*Flow
sequence content* is denoted by surrounding *“**`[`**”* and
*“**`]`**”*
characters.

[191]

c-flow-sequence(n,c)

::=

c-sequence-start
s-separate(n,c))?

ns-s-flow-seq-inner(n,c))*

ns-s-flow-seq-last(n,c))?

c-sequence-end

Sequence entries are separated by a “**`,`**” character.

[192]

ns-s-flow-seq-inner(n,c)

::=

ns-s-flow-seq-entry(n,c))
c-collect-entry
s-separate(n,c))?

The final entry may omit the “**`,`**” character. This does not cause
ambiguity since sequence entries must not be completely empty.

[193]

ns-s-flow-seq-last(n,c)

::=

ns-s-flow-seq-entry(n,c))

**Example 10.1. Flow Sequence**

``` example
- [ inner, inner, ]
- [inner,last]
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-sequence-start c-sequence-end
  ns-s-flow-seq-inner(n,c)
  ns-s-flow-seq-last(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!seq [
    !!str "inner",
    !!str "inner",
  ],
  !!seq [
    !!str "inner",
    !!str "last",
  ],
]
```

Any flow
node may be used as a flow sequence entry. In addition,
YAML provides a compact form for the case where a flow sequence
entry is a mapping with a single
key: value pair, and neither the mapping node nor its
single key node
have any properties
specified.

[194]

ns-s-flow-seq-entry(n,c)

::=

  ( #ns-flow-node(n,c)#in-flow(c)))

    #s-separate(n,c)#in-flow(c)))? )

| #ns-s-flow-single-pair(n,c)#in-flow(c)))

**Example 10.2. Flow Sequence Entries**

``` example
[
"double
 quoted", 'single
           quoted',
plain
 text, [ nested ],
single: pair ,
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-flow-node(n,c)
  ns-s-flow-single-pair(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "double quoted",
  !!str "single quoted",
  !!str "plain text",
  !!seq [
    !!str "nested",
  ],
  !!map {
    ? !!str "single"
    : !!str "pair"
  }
]
```

### 10.1.2. Block Sequences

A *block
sequence* is simply a series of entries, each presenting a single node.

[195]

c-l-block-sequence(n,c)

::=

c-l-comments
l-block-seq-entry(n,c))+

**Example 10.3. Block Sequence**

``` example
block: # Block
       # sequence↓
- one↓
- two : three↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-l-comments
  l-block-seq-entry(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "block"
  : !!seq [
    !!str "one",
    !!map {
      ? !!str "two"
      : !!str "three"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each block sequence entry is denoted by a leading *“**`-`**”
indicator*, separated by spaces from the entry node.

[196]

l-block-seq-entry(n,c)

::=

s-indent(n)))
c-sequence-entry

s-l+block-indented(n,c),c))

People read the “**`-`**” character as part of the
indentation. Hence,
block sequence entries require one less space of indentation, unless the block
sequence is nested within another block sequence (hence the need
for the *block-in
context* and *block-out context*).

[197]

seq-spaces(n,c)

::=

c = block-out ⇒ n-1

c = block-in  ⇒ n

**Example 10.4. Block Sequence Entry Indentation**

``` example
block:
- one
-
·- two
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-indent(n)
  s-l+block-indented(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "block"
  : !!seq [
    !!str "one",
    !!seq [
      !!str "two"
    ]
  ]
}
```

The entry node
may be either completely
empty, a normal block node, or use a compact in-line
form.

[198]

s-l+block-indented(n,c)

::=

  #s-l-empty-block

| #s-l+block-node(n,c))

| #s-l+block-in-line(n))

The compact *in-line* form may be used in the common
case when the block sequence entry is itself a block
collection, and neither the collection entry nor its first nested
node have any
properties specified. In
this case, the nested collection may be specified in the
same line as the “**`-`**” character, and any following
spaces are considered part of the in-line nested collection’s
indentation.

[199]

s-l+block-in-line(n)

::=

s-indent(n))

( #ns-l-in-line-sequence(n))

| #ns-l-in-line-mapping(n)) )

An *in-line block
sequence* begins with an indented same-line sequence entry, followed by
optional additional normal block sequence entries, properly
indented.

[200]

ns-l-in-line-sequence(n)

::=

c-sequence-entry
s-l+block-indented(n,c))

l-block-seq-entry(n,c))*

**Example 10.5. Block Sequence Entry Types**

``` example
- # Empty
- |
 block node
-·- one # in-line
··- two # sequence
- one: two # in-line
           # mapping
```
``` example
Legend:
  s-l-empty-block
  s-l+block-node(n,c)
  s-l+block-in-line(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!str "",
  !!str "block node\n",
  !!seq [
    !!str "one",
    !!str "two",
  ]
  !!map {
    ? !!str "one"
    : !!str "two",
  }
]
```

## 10.2. Mapping Styles

A *mapping node*
is an unordered collection of *key:* *value* pairs. Of necessity, these pairs are
presented in some order in the characters stream. As a serialization detail, this
key order is preserved in the
serialization tree. However
it is not reflected in the representation graph and hence must
not be used when constructing
native data structures. It is an error for two equal keys to appear in the same mapping
node. In such a case the YAML processor may continue, ignoring the
second key: value pair and issuing an appropriate warning. This
strategy preserves a consistent information model for one-pass and
random access applications.

### 10.2.1. Flow Mappings

*Flow
mapping content* is denoted by surrounding *“**`{`**”* and
*“**`}`**”*
characters.

[201]

c-flow-mapping(n,c)

::=

c-mapping-start
s-separate(n,c))?

ns-s-flow-map-inner(n,c))*

ns-s-flow-map-last(n,c))?

c-mapping-end

Mapping entries are separated by a “**`,`**” character.

[202]

ns-s-flow-map-inner(n,c)

::=

ns-s-flow-map-entry(n,c))
c-collect-entry
s-separate(n,c))?

The final entry may omit the “**`,`**” character. This does not cause
ambiguity since mapping entries must not be completely empty.

[203]

ns-s-flow-map-last(n,c)

::=

ns-s-flow-map-entry(n,c))

**Example 10.6. Flow Mappings**

``` example
- { inner : entry , also: inner , }
- {inner: entry,last : entry}
```
``` example

``` example
%YAML 1.1

    : !!str "entry",
    ? !!str "also"
    : !!str "inner"

Flow mappings allow two forms of keys: explicit and simple.

Explicit Keys
An *explicit key* is
denoted by the *“**`?`**” indicator*, followed by
separation
spaces.

[204]

s-flow-separated(n,c)

::=

  ( #s-separate(n,c))
ns-flow-node(n,c)#in-flow(c)))

    #s-separate(n,c))? )

| ( #e-empty-flow
s-separate(n,c)) )

[205]

c-s-flow-explicit-key(n,c)

::=

c-mapping-key
s-flow-separated(n,c))

Simple Keys
A *simple key* has no
identifying mark. It is recognized as being a key either due to
being inside a flow mapping, or by being followed by an
explicit value. Hence, to avoid unbound lookahead in YAML
processors, simple keys
are restricted to a single line and must not span more than
1024 stream characters (hence the need
for the *flow-key
context*). Note the 1024 character limit is in terms
of Unicode characters rather than stream octets, and that it
includes the separation following the key itself.

[206]

ns-s-flow-simple-key(n,c)

::=

ns-flow-node(n,c))
s-flow-separated(n,c))?

**Example 10.7. Flow Mapping Keys**

``` example
{
?° : value # Empty key
? explicit
 key: value,
simple key : value
[ collection, simple, key ]: value
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-s-flow-explicit-key(n,c)
  ns-s-flow-simple-key(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str ""
  : !!str "value",
  ? !!str "explicit key"
  : !!str "value",
  ? !!str "simple key"
  : !!str "value",
  ? !!seq [
    !!str "collection",
    !!str "simple",
    !!str "key"
  ]
  : !!str "value"
}
```

**Example 10.8. Invalid Flow Mapping Keys**

``` example
{
multi-line
 simple key : value,
very long ...(>1KB)... key: value
}
```

``` example
ERROR:
- A simple key is restricted
  to only one line.
- A simple key must not be
  longer than 1024 characters.
```

Flow mappings also allow two forms of values, explicit and completely empty.

Explicit Values
An *explicit value*
is denoted by the *“**`:`**” indicator*, followed by
separation
spaces.

[207]

c-s-flow-explicit-value(n,c)

::=

c-mapping-value
s-flow-separated(n,c))

**Example 10.9. Flow Mapping Values**

``` example
{
key : value,
empty:° # empty value↓
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-s-flow-explicit-value(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "key"
  : !!str "value",
  ? !!str "empty"
  : !!str "",
}
```

Thus, there are four possible combinations for a flow mapping
entry:

- Explicit key and explicit value:

[208]

c-s-flow-explicit-explicit(n,c)

::=

c-s-flow-explicit-key(n,c))

c-s-flow-explicit-value(n,c))

- Explicit key and completely empty value:

[209]

c-s-flow-explicit-empty(n,c)

::=

c-s-flow-explicit-key(n,c))
e-empty-flow

- Simple key and explicit value:

[210]

ns-s-flow-simple-explicit(n,c)

::=

ns-s-flow-simple-key(n,c))

c-s-flow-explicit-value(n,c))

- Simple key and completely empty value:

[211]

ns-s-flow-simple-empty(n,c)

::=

ns-s-flow-simple-key(n,c))
e-empty-flow

Inside flow mappings, all four combinations may be used.

[212]

ns-s-flow-map-entry(n,c)

::=

  #c-s-flow-explicit-explicit(n,c))

| #c-s-flow-explicit-empty(n,c))

| #ns-s-flow-simple-explicit(n,c))

| #ns-s-flow-simple-empty(n,c))

**Example 10.10. Flow Mapping Key: Value Pairs**

``` example
{
? explicit key1 : Explicit value,
? explicit key2 :° , # Explicit empty
? explicit key3,     # Empty value
simple key1 : explicit value,
simple key2 :° ,     # Explicit empty
simple key3,         # Empty value
}
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-s-flow-explicit-explicit(n,c)
  c-s-flow-explicit-empty(n,c)
  ns-s-flow-simple-explicit(n,c)
  ns-s-flow-simple-empty(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "explicit key1"
  : !!str "explicit value",
  ? !!str "explicit key2"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "explicit key3"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "simple key1"
  : !!str "explicit value",
  ? !!str "simple key2"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "simple key3"
  : !!str "",
}
```

YAML also allows omitting the surrounding “**`{`**” and
“**`}`**” characters when nesting a flow mapping in a
flow
sequence if the mapping consists of a *single
key: value pair* and neither the mapping nor the key
have any properties
specified. In this case, only three of the combinations may be
used, to prevent ambiguity.

[213]

ns-s-flow-single-pair(n,c)

::=

  #c-s-flow-explicit-explicit(n,c))

| #c-s-flow-explicit-empty(n,c))

| #ns-s-flow-simple-explicit(n,c))

**Example 10.11. Single Pair Mappings**

``` example
[
? explicit key1 : explicit value,
? explicit key2 :° , # Explicit empty
? explicit key3,     # Implicit empty
simple key1 : explicit value,
simple key2 :° ,     # Explicit empty
]
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-s-flow-explicit-explicit(n,c)
  c-s-flow-explicit-empty(n,c)
  ns-s-flow-simple-explicit(n,c)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq [
  !!map {
    ? !!str "explicit key1"
    : !!str "explicit value",
  },
  !!map {
    ? !!str "explicit key2"
    : !!str "",
  },
  !!map {
    ? !!str "explicit key3"
    : !!str "",
  },
  !!map {
    ? !!str "simple key1"
    : !!str "explicit value",
  },
  !!map {
    ? !!str "simple key2"
    : !!str "",
  },
]
```

### 10.2.2. Block Mappings

A *Block
mapping* is simply a series of entries, each presenting a key: value pair.

[214]

c-l-block-mapping(n)

::=

c-l-comments

( #s-indent(n))
ns-l-block-map-entry(n)) )+

**Example 10.12. Block Mappings**

``` example
block: # Block
    # mapping↓
·key: value↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  c-l-comments
  s-indent(n)
  ns-l-block-map-entry(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "block"
  : !!map {
    ? !!str "key",
    : !!str "value"
  }
}
```

A block mapping entry may be presented using either an explicit or a
simple key.

[215]

ns-l-block-map-entry(n)

::=

  #ns-l-block-explicit-entry(n))

| #ns-l-block-simple-entry(n))

Explicit Key Entries
Explicit key nodes
are denoted by the “**`?`**” character. YAML allows here
the same inline compact notation described
above for block sequence entries, in which
case the “**`?`**” character is considered part
of the key’s indentation.

[216]

ns-l-block-explicit-key(n)

::=

c-mapping-key
s-l+block-indented(n,c))

- In an explicit key entry, value nodes begin on a separate line
  and are denoted by by the “**`:`**” character. Here again YAML
  allows the use of the inline compact notation which case
  the “**`:`**” character is considered part
  of the values’s indentation.

[217]

l-block-explicit-value(n)

::=

s-indent(n))
c-mapping-value

s-l+block-indented(n,c))

- An explicit key entry may also use a completely empty value.

[218]

ns-l-block-explicit-entry(n)

::=

ns-l-block-explicit-key(n))

( #l-block-explicit-value(n))

| #e-empty-flow )

**Example 10.13. Explicit Block Mapping Entries**

``` example
? explicit key # implicit value↓°
? |
  block key↓
:·- one # explicit in-line
··- two # block value↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-l-block-explicit-key(n)
  l-block-explicit-value(n)
  e-empty-flow
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "explicit key"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "block key\n"
  : !!seq [
    !!str "one",
    !!str "two",
  ]
}
```

Simple Key Entries
YAML allows the “**`?`**” character to be omitted for
simple keys. Similarly
to flow mapping, such a key is recognized by a following
“**`:`**”
character. Again, to avoid unbound lookahead in YAML processors, simple keys are
restricted to a single line and must not span more than 1024
stream
characters. Again, this limit is in terms of Unicode characters
rather than stream octets, and includes the separation following the
key, if any.

[219]

ns-block-simple-key(n)

::=

ns-flow-node(n,c))

s-separate(n,c))?
c-mapping-value

- In a simple key entry, an explicit value node may be presented in the same line. Note
  however that in this case, the key is not considered to be a form
  of indentation,
  hence the compact in-line notation must not be used.
  The value following the simple key may also be completely empty.

[220]

s-l+block-simple-value(n)

::=

  #s-l+block-node(n,c))

| #s-l-empty-block

[221]

ns-l-block-simple-entry(n)

::=

ns-block-simple-key(n))

s-l+block-simple-value(n))

**Example 10.14. Simple Block Mapping Entries**

``` example
plain key:° # empty value↓
"quoted key":↓
- one # explicit next-line
- two # block value↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-block-simple-key(n)
  s-l+block-simple-value(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!map {
  ? !!str "plain key"
  : !!str "",
  ? !!str "quoted key\n"
  : !!seq [
    !!str "one",
    !!str "two",
  ]
}
```

An *in-line block
mapping* begins with a same-line mapping entry, followed
by optional additional normal block mapping entries, properly
indented.

[222]

ns-l-in-line-mapping(n)

::=

ns-l-block-map-entry(n))

( #s-indent(n))
ns-l-block-map-entry(n)) )*

**Example 10.15. In-Line Block Mappings**

``` example
- sun: yellow↓
- ? earth: blue↓
  : moon: white↓
```
``` example
Legend:
  ns-l-in-line-mapping(n)
```

``` example
%YAML 1.1
---
!!seq {
  !!map {
    ? !!str "sun"
    : !!str "yellow",
  },
  !!map {
    ? !!map {
      ? !!str "earth"
      : !!str "blue"
    }
    : !!map {
      ? !!str "moon"
      : !!str "white"
    }
  }
}
```
